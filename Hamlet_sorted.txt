ACT III
ACT V
ACT IV
A Norman.
A Norman was't?
ACT I
A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
ACT II
about my heart: but it is no matter.
About the world have times twelve thirties been,
about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
a carpenter?'
According to the phrase or the addition
A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
A combination and a form indeed,
a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
A double blessing is a double grace,
A dream itself is but a shadow.
[Advancing] What is he whose grief
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
Affront Ophelia:
A face without a heart?
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within
Against some part of Poland.
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
Against the which, a moiety competent
A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
A hit, a very palpable hit.
Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
A king of shreds and patches,--
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
Alack, what noise is this?
Alack,
Alas, alas!
Alas, he's mad!
Alack, and fie for shame!
Alas, how is't with you,
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
Alas, look here, my lord.
Alas, poor ghost!
Alas, then, she is drown'd?
Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
All
All
All
All
All flaxen was his poll:
All given to mine ear.
All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
All in the morning betime,
All my smooth body.
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
A ministering angel shall my sister be,
Among a mineral of metals base,
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
And I a maid at your window,
And I am sick at heart.
And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--
And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
And I do think, or else this brain of mine
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
And I the matter will re-word; which madness
And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
And after we will both our judgments join
And am most sensible in grief for it,
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
And, as I think, they have already order
And all we mourn for.
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
And, as the world were now but to begin,
And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
And at our more consider'd time well read,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
And bear it to the chapel.
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
All may be well.
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
And break your own neck down.
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
And call it accident.
And call the noblest to the audience.
And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
And carriage of the article design'd,
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
A murderer and a villain;
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
And could of men distinguish, her election
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
And drive his purpose on to these delights.
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
And draw you into madness? think of it:
And dupp'd the chamber-door;
And do such bitter business as the day
And either [ ] the devil, or throw him out
And each particular hair to stand on end,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
And ever three parts coward, I do not know
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
And foreign mart for implements of war;
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
And for your rapier most especially,
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
And gather by him, as he is behaved,
And gave you such a masterly report
And gem of all the nation.
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
And hath abatements and delays as many
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
And hears it roar beneath.
And hath shipped me intil the land,
And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
And he to England shall along with you:
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
And his sandal shoon.
And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
And hurt my brother.
And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--
'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
And in the cup an union shall he throw,
And in the porches of my ears did pour
And, in this brainish apprehension, kills
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
And lay your hands again upon my sword:
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
And leads the will to desperate undertakings
And let him know so.
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
And let him ply his music.
And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
And let them know, both what we mean to do,
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
And let us once again assail your ears,
And liegemen to the Dane.
After the thing it loves.
And like a neutral to his will and matter,
And, like a man to double business bound,
And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
And live the purer with the other half.
And makes each petty artery in this body
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
And more above, hath his solicitings,
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
And my imaginations are as foul
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
And never come mischance between us twain!
And not have strew'd thy grave.
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
And nothing is at a like goodness still;
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;
And not where I had aim'd them.
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.
And our affairs from England come too late:
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
And passion in the gods.'
And pious action we do sugar o'er
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
And prologue to the omen coming on,
And prey on garbage.
And put it in his pocket!
And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
And recks not his own rede.
And set a double varnish on the fame
And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
And reason panders will.
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
And smelt so? pah!
And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
And so have I a noble father lost;
And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
And so, without more circumstance at all,
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--
And that I see, in passages of proof,
And sure I am two men there are not living
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
And that our drift look through our bad performance,
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
And then it started like a guilty thing
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
And the queen too, and that presently.
And there I see such black and grained spots
And there assume some other horrible form,
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
And these few precepts in thy memory
And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:
And they in France of the best rank and station
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
And tell you what I know.
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
And thus the native hue of resolution
And, to the last, bended their light on me.
And thy commandment all alone shall live
And to the manner born, it is a custom
And vanish'd from our sight.
And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
And we did think it writ down in our duty
And we shall jointly labour with your soul
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
And we cast away moan:
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
And what's untimely done. O, come away!
And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
And will he not come again?
And will not let belief take hold of him
And will this brother's wager frankly play.
And will not wrong it.
And with a larger tether may he walk
And with a look so piteous in purport
And will he not come again?
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
And with a sudden vigour doth posset
And with no less nobility of love
And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
And you must put me in your heart for friend,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
An earnest conjuration from the king,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
Anon, as patient as the female dove,
A noise within
An thou hadst not come to my bed.
Another hit; what say you?
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
Answer, and think upon this business.
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
An you call him a-down-a.
'Anon he finds him
Appears before them, and with solemn march
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
Are here arrived give order that these bodies
A piece of him.
Are joyfully return'd.
Are you fair?
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
Arm'd, my lord.
Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
Arm'd, say you?
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
As England was his faithful tributary,
As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
A sable silver'd.
As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
As are companions noted and most known
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
As checking at his voyage, and that he means
'As by lot, God wot,'
A scullion!
As day does to your eye.
As did that one, and that, in my regard,
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
A second time I kill my husband dead,
As e'er my conversation coped withal.
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
As fits a king's remembrance.
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
As from the body of contraction plucks
As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
As he in his particular act and place
As gaming, my lord.
As he is very potent with such spirits,
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
[Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
Aside
[Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my
[Aside] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
[Aside] It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.
[Aside] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
[Aside] Still on my daughter.
[Aside] O, 'tis too true!
[Aside] Wormwood, wormwood.
[Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is method
As if he had been loosed out of hell
As if it some impartment did desire
As if I had never been such.
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
As infinite as man may undergo--
As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
As if increase of appetite had grown
A sister driven into desperate terms,
[Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
As it doth well appear unto our state--
As it is common for the younger sort
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
As kill a king!
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
As love between them like the palm might flourish,
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
As make your bouts more violent to that end--
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
As of a father: for let the world take note,
As of a man faithful and honourable.
As oft as any passion under heaven
As one incapable of her own distress,
As low as to the fiends!'
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
A station like the herald Mercury
As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
As the indifferent children of the earth.
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
As therein are set down.
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
As they fell out by time, by means and place,
As thou art to thyself:
As thou'rt a man,
As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
As to peace-parted souls.
As to expend your time with us awhile,
As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
As woman's love.
A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
At gaming, swearing, or about some act
At his head a grass-green turf,
At his heels a stone.
At home, my lord.
A thing, my lord!
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
At last, a little shaking of mine arm
A touch, a touch, I do confess.
A truant disposition, good my lord.
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
At supper! where?
At supper.
Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
A very noble youth: mark.
A very riband in the cap of youth,
A very, very--pajock.
A villain kills my father; and for that,
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Away, I do beseech you, both away:
Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
Ay, Hamlet.
Ay, amen!
Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
A whole one, I.
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
Ay, lady, 'twas my word.
Ay, madam, it is common.
Ay, good my lord.
Ay me, what act,
Ay, marry, is't:
Ay, my good lord.
Ay, my lord;
Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord,
Ay, my lord.
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
Ay, my lord.
Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you
Ay, my lord.
Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
Ay, sir, what of him?
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner

Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
Be all my sins remember'd.
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
Been struck so to the soul that presently
Before my daughter told me--what might you,
Before you visit him, to make inquire
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
Before my God, I might not this believe
[Behind] O, I am slain!
Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
[Behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
Being a thing immortal as itself?
Behind the arras hearing something stir,
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
Believe me, I cannot.
Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
Believe what?
[Beneath] Swear.
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
[Beneath] Swear.
[Beneath] Swear.
Believe so much in him, that he is young
[Beneath] Swear.
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
Bernardo?
Bernardo has my place.
Be ruled; you shall not go.
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
As will not leave their tinct.
Bestow this place on us a little while.
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Between who?
Between the pass and fell incensed points
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Be you and I behind an arras then;
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Be you content to lend your patience to us,
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
Both to my God and to my gracious king:
Both your majesties
Bid the players make haste.
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
Bring him before us.
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
But I do prophesy the election lights
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
But I have that within which passeth show;
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
But age, with his stealing steps,
But I will delve one yard below their mines,
But answer made it none: yet once methought
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
But, better look'd into, he truly found
But, as we often see, against some storm,
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
But do not go with it.
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
But farewell it, for I will use no art.
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
But how hath she
But he's an arrant knave.
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
But if the gods themselves did see her then
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
But, if you hold it fit, after the play
But in battalions. First, her father slain:
But in our circumstance and course of thought,
But is this law?
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
But it reserved some quantity of choice,
But keep a farm and carters.
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
But let me hear from you.
But let that go.
But let this same be presently perform'd,
But, like the owner of a foul disease,
But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
But from what cause he will by no means speak.
But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;

But, my good lord,--
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
But not by him.
But never doubt I love.
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
But, orderly to end where I begun,
But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
But that the dread of something after death,
But that I know love is begun by time;
But that this folly douts it.
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
But this eternal blazon must not be
But these cannot I command to any utterance of

But to recover of us, by strong hand

But we both obey,

But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
But what we do determine oft we break.
But where is he?
'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'
But where was this?
But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
But with much forcing of his disposition.
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother

By cock, they are to blame.

By heaven, it is as proper to our age
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
By indirections find directions out:
By his cockle hat and staff,
By letters congruing to that effect,
By laboursome petition, and at last
By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.

By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
Calmly, good Laertes.
Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It
Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
Can you advise me?
Came this from Hamlet to her?
Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:

Christian burial.
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Christian burial.
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
Collected from all simples that have virtue
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
Cock crows
Come, I will make you way for these your letters;
Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
Come hither, gentlemen,
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
Come, let me wipe thy face.
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
Come, my lord.
Come, one for me.
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
Come on, sir.
Come, sirs.
Come short of what he did.
Come, some music!
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
Conceit upon her father.
Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
Consent to swear.
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
Couch we awhile, and mark.
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
Could force his soul so to his own conceit
Could not so mope.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
Could not, with all their quantity of love,
Craves the conveyance of a promised march
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,

Dead.
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
Denmark's a prison.
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Did he receive you well?
Did nothing.
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Did not together pluck such envy from him
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Did you not speak to it?
Did you assay him?
Dies
Dies
Dies
Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw
Dies in his own too much: that we would do
Directly seasons him his enemy.
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
Does by their own insinuation grow:
Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
Do, if it will not stand.
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Do not forget: this visitation
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
Do not believe it.
Do not, my lord.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
Do the boys carry it away?
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
Doubt that the sun doth move;
Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
Do you know me, my lord?
Do you see this, O God?
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
Do you see nothing there?
Do you think I meant country matters?
Do you think 'tis this?
Do you doubt that?
Drabbing: you may go so far.
[Drawing] How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!
Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
Drown'd, drown'd.
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
Each small annexment, petty consequence,
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
Ecstasy!
E'en so.
Drown'd! O, where?
E'en that.
Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
E'en so, my lord.
England! Farewell, dear mother.

He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love

Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
Ha!
Had he the motive and the cue for passion
Had it the ability of life to thank you:
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
Ha, ha! are you honest?
Hail to your lordship!
Half a share.
Hamlet, Hamlet!
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
Hamlet the Dane.
Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
Haply the seas and countries different
Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he
Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters
Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
Have after. To what issue will this come?
Have at you now!
Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
Have you forgot me?
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
Have you had quiet guard?
Have you so slander any moment leisure,
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
He.
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
Hear you, sir;
Heaven will direct it.
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
He closes with you in this consequence;
Heavens make our presence and our practises
He digs and sings
He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
He does confess he feels himself distracted;
He falls to such perusal of my face
He does well to commend it himself; there are no
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
He is dead and gone;
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
He is dead and gone, lady,
He is gone, he is gone,
He likewise gives a frock or livery,
He made confession of you,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
He never gave commandment for their death.
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
He never will come again.
He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His
Help, help, ho!
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
Her brother is in secret come from France;
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Here in the lobby.
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
He is justly served;
Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
Here's to thy health.
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
Here stooping to your clemency,
Here's yet some liquor left.
Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
Her father and myself, lawful espials,
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
He's fat, and scant of breath.
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
He should the bearers put to sudden death,
Her mood will needs be pitied.
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
He's loved of the distracted multitude,
He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
He took my father grossly, full of bread;
'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
He waxes desperate with imagination.
He was a man, take him for all in all,
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
He will stay till ye come.
Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
He was the first that ever bore arms.
High on a stage be placed to the view;
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on
His access to me.
His beard was grizzled--no?
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
His beard was as white as snow,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
His means of death, his obscure funeral--
His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
His liberty is full of threats to all;
His silence will sit drooping.
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
Hold off your hands.
Holla! Bernardo!
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
Honest, my lord!
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the
How all occasions do inform against me,
How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
Hold you the watch to-night?
How came he mad?
How chances it they travel? their residence, both
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
How does the queen?
How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
How does your honour for this many a day?
How do you, pretty lady?
Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
How fares my lord?
How comes it? do they grow rusty?
How if I answer 'no'?
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
How is it with you, lady?
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
How is't, my noble lord?
How is't, Laertes?
How long hath she been thus?
How long is that since?
How in my words soever she be shent,
How may we try it further?
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
How much I had to do to calm his rage!
How now, Ophelia!
How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?
How now! what hath befall'n?
How now, sweet queen!
How now! what news?
How now! what noise is that?
How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
How purposed, sir, I pray you?
How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
How strangely?
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
How these things came about: so shall you hear
How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
How should I your true love know
How was this seal'd?
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
I am glad to see you well:
I am satisfied in nature,
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
I am thy father's spirit,
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
I am tame, sir: pronounce.
I beseech you.
I bought an unction of a mountebank,
I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
I beseech you, remember--
I commend my duty to your lordship.
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
I cannot live to hear the news from England;
I could interpret between you and your love, if I
I could not but by her. The other motive,
I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.
I did repel his fetters and denied
I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
I did very well note him.
I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
I do not know from what part of the world
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
I do not think so: since he went into France, I
I do beseech you.
I do not think't.
I doubt it is no other but the main;
I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
I embrace it freely;
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
If by direct or by collateral hand
I do not well understand that. Will you play upon
If damned custom have not brass'd it so
If circumstances lead me, I will find
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
If his chief good and market of his time
I find thee apt;
If it assume my noble father's person,
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
If it be,
If it be made of penetrable stuff,
I do believe you think what now you speak;
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
If it be so, Laertes--
If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
If she should break it now!
If 't be the affliction of his love or no
If there be any good thing to be done,
If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
If that his majesty would aught with us,
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
If you desire to know the certainty
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
I had my father's signet in my purse,
I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
I have a voice and precedent of peace,
I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
I have, my lord.
I have in quick determination
I have seen nothing.
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God
I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
I have sworn 't.
I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
I, his sole son, do this same villain send
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
I know no touch of it, my lord.
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
I know you are not ignorant--
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
I'll be with you straight go a little before.
I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows
I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
I'll board him presently.
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
I'll rant as well as thou.
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
I'll warrant you,
I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
I loved your father, and we love ourself;
I'll visit you.
I made to her in marriage, and to decline
I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
I mean, my head upon your lap?
Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
Importing the surrender of those lands
Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
I must to England; you know that?
I must be cruel, only to be kind:
In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
In censure of his seeming.
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
Indeed, that is out o' the air.
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
I never gave you aught.
In faith,
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
In filial obligation for some term
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
In general synod 'take away her power;
In further evil?
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
In happy time.
In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
'In her excellent white bosom, these, & c.'
In honourable fashion.
In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
In neither aught, or in extremity.
In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
In obstinate condolement is a course
In noise so rude against me?
In second husband let me be accurst!
In that and all things will we show our duty.
In the corrupted currents of this world
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
In thee there is not half an hour of life;
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
Into a towering passion.
Into my grave.
Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
Into the madness wherein now he raves,
In what, my dear lord?
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
In what particular thought to work I know not;
In youth, when I did love, did love,
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she
I pray you.
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
I pray you.
I pray you, give me leave.
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
I pray you, now receive them.
I pray you, pass with your best violence;
I pray you, go with me.
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
Is by a forged process of my death
I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
I shall not look upon his like again.
I shall, my lord.
I shall obey you.
I shall obey, my lord.
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
I should have fatted all the region kites
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
Is it a custom?
Is it not like the king?
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
Is it the king?
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
Is not this something more than fantasy?
Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
Is not to stir without great argument,
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
I stay too long: but here my father comes.
Is the great love the general gender bear him;
Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
Is the main motive of our preparations,
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
Is't possible?
Is thought-sick at the act.
Is very cunning in.
Is't possible?
'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
It beckons you to go away with it,
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
It falls right.
It could not move thus.
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave
It had been so with us, had we been there:
I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
I think it be no other but e'en so:
I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
I think it lacks of twelve.
I think nothing, my lord.
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
It is a nipping and an eager air.
It is a poison temper'd by himself.
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
It is backed like a weasel.
It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
It is most retrograde to our desire:
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
It is offended.
It lifted up its head and did address
It may be, very likely.
It might, my lord.
It likes us well;
It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For
It must be shortly known to him from England
I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
It may be death.
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
It shall as level to your judgment pierce
It sends some precious instance of itself
It shall be so:
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
It shall do well: but yet do I believe
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
It warms the very sickness in my heart,
It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
It waves me still.
It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
It well appears: but tell me
It will be short: the interim is mine;
It will be laid to us, whose providence
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
It waves you to a more removed ground:
It will not speak; then I will follow it.
It would have much amazed you.
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
I warrant it will.
It would be spoke to.
I warrant your honour.
I was the more deceived.
I will bestow him, and will answer well
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
I will do't:
I will.
I will do't, my lord.
I will, my lord.
I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.
I understand you not, my lord.
I will not speak with her.
I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
I will say so.
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
I will watch to-night;
I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
I would I had been there.
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
I would know that.
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
I would not hear your enemy say so,
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,

Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
LORD POLONIUS
'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'
LORD POLONIUS
Larded with many several sorts of reasons
Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.
Last, and as much containing as all these,
Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Last night of all,
Lay her i' the earth:
Leaps into the grave
Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
Led by a delicate and tender prince,
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
Leave me, friends.
Lest with this piteous action you convert
Let her come in.
Let Hercules himself do what he may,
Leaps into the grave
Let four captains
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged
Let him bless thee too.
Let him demand his fill.
Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
Let in the maid, that out a maid
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
Let me be no assistant for a state,
Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
Let me see.
Let me question more in particular: what have you,
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
Larded with sweet flowers
Let's follow, Gertrude:
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
Let's further think of this;
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
Let this be so;
Let them come in.
Let us haste to hear it,
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Lights, lights, lights!
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS
Like a good child and a true gentleman.
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
Longer, longer.
Like to a murdering-piece, in many places
Looking before and after, gave us not
Long live the king!
Look, my lord, it comes!
Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
Look to the queen there, ho!
Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!
Look, with what courteous action
Look you, I'll go pray.
Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
Love! his affections do not that way tend;

Look you, these are the stops.

Madam, how like you this play?
MARCELLUS HORATIO
Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
Mad for thy love?
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
MARCELLUS
Makes a pass through the arras
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
Makes mouths at the invisible event,
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
Makes vow before his uncle never more
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
Make you to ravel all this matter out,
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
March within
March afar off, and shot within
Mark me.
Mark the encounter: if he love her not
Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
Marry, sir, here's my drift;
Marry, now I can tell.
Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
Marry, well bethought:
Mass, I cannot tell.
Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
May be the devil: and the devil hath power
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
May do, to express his love and friending to you,
May give his saying deed; which is no further
May sweep to my revenge.
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
Messenger
Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
Methinks it is like a weasel.
Messenger
Methought it was very sweet,
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
Mine, sir.
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
More matter, with less art.
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
More relative than this: the play 's the thing
More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
More than in words?
Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
Most constantly.
Most free in his reply.
Most fair return of greetings and desires.
Most generous and free from all contriving,
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
Most holy and religious fear it is
Most thoroughly for my father.
Most necessary 'tis that we forget
Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor
Most welcome home!
Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
Mother, you have my father much offended.
Murder!
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
Murder of Gonzago?
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
Must give us pause: there's the respect
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
Must there no more be done?
My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
Must render up myself.
My custom always of the afternoon,
My dread lord,
My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
My father, in his habit as he lived!
My fate cries out,
My father's brother, but no more like my father
My father!--methinks I see my father.
My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
Most like a gentleman.
My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
My good lord--
My head should be struck off.
My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
My honoured lord!
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
My lord?
My liege, and madam, to expostulate
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
My hour is almost come,
My lord, I do not know;
My lord, I did;
My lord, I have.
My lord, I have news to tell you.
My lord, I have news to tell you.
My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
My lord, I did intend it.
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
My lord, I'll hit him now.
My lord, I will be ruled;
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
My lord, I cannot.
My lord, he hath importuned me with love
My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
My lord, not I.
My lord, that would dishonour him.
My lord, the king your father.
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
My lord, the queen would speak with you, and
My lord, we were sent for.
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
My lord, we will not.
My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
My lord, you once did love me.
My lord, from head to foot.
My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
My operant powers their functions leave to do:
My most dear lord!
My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
My stern effects: then what I have to do
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
My soul is full of discord and dismay.
My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
My will, not all the world:
Nay, I know not:
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
Nay, but, Ophelia,--
Nay, but to live
Nay, I know not.
Nay, come, again.
Nay, come, let's go together.
Nay, do not think I flatter;
Nay, good my lord,--
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
Nay, let's follow him.
Nay, very pale.
Nay, that follows not.
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
Never believe it:
Neither, my lord.
Never departed more.
Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
Never to speak of this that you have seen,
Never to speak of this that you have heard,
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
No!
No.
No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
No, by no means.
No, by this hand.
No, by the rood, not so:
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
No, it is struck.
No, indeed, are they not.
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
Noise within
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
No, let's come in.
No medicine in the world can do thee good;
No more!
No more be done:
No more but so?
No more, sweet Hamlet!
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
No, my good lord.
No more to undertake it, I will work him
No, my lord.
No, my lord, rather with choler.
None but his enemies.
No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
No noble rite nor formal ostentation--
Nay, but swear't.
No, no, he is dead:
No, nor mine now.
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
No, not I;
No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
No, nothing but ourselves.
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
Nor did you nothing hear?
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
Nor I, my lord.
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor the soles of her shoe?
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
Nor thine on me.
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
Not I, my lord.
No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
Not a mouse stirring.
Not from his mouth,
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
Nothing, neither way.
Not of that dye which their investments show,
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
Not a jot more, my lord.
Not shriving-time allow'd.
Not that I know.
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
Not that I think you did not love your father;
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
Not when I saw't.
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
Now I am alone.
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Now fear I this will give it start again;
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Now falls on Priam.
Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
Now, mother, what's the matter?
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
Now, out of this,--
Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
Now wears his crown.
No; you'll reveal it.
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
O God!
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
O Gertrude, come away!
O Hamlet, speak no more:
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
O, I die, Horatio;
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!

Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
Of Laertes?
Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day
Of all their conference. If she find him not,
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
Of bell and burial.
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
Of blue Olympus.
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
Of general assault.
O, fear me not.
Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
Of him that brought them.
Of him, sir.
Of his true state.
Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
Of his behavior.
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
Of man and country.
Of mine own eyes.
Of mighty opposites.
Of my true mother.
Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
O, for two special reasons;
Of his affection to me.
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
Of these delated articles allow.
Of thinking too precisely on the event,
Of the unworthiest siege.
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
Of those effects for which I did the murder,
Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
Of violent birth, but poor validity;
O, give me leave:
O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
O heavenly powers, restore him!
O, he is mad, Laertes.
O heavy burthen!
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
O heavy deed!
O most pernicious woman!
O me, what hast thou done?
O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
O, my dear lord,--
O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
O my son, what theme?
On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
O, here they come.
One.
One scene of it comes near the circumstance
O, methought, there was nothing meet.
One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
'One fair daughter and no more,
One word more, good lady.
One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
On plots and errors, happen.
On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
On such regards of safety and allowance
Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
On wholesome life usurp immediately.
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
Or for some frontier?
Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
Or like a creature native and indued
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
Or like a whale?
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
Or not at all.
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
O, speak to me no more;
O royal knavery!--an exact command,
Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with
O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
O, step between her and her fighting soul:
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
O, throw away the worser part of it,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,
Our duty to your honour.
O, treble woe
Our purpose may hold there.
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
Our son shall win.
Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
Our wills and fates do so contrary run
Out of his lunacies.
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
Over the nasty sty,--
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
O, vengeance!
O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
O, wonderful!
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
PRINCE FORTINBRAS

POLONIUS hides behind the arras

Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;

Pale or red?
Part them; they are incensed.
Passing through nature to eternity.
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set
Perchance 'twill walk again.
Peace! who comes here?
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
Player King
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing

O wretched state! O bosom black as death!

Sir, a whole history.
Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
Sir, in this audience,
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
SCENE V. Another part of the platform.
Sit down awhile;
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
Sleep rock thy brain,
Sleeps
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
So be it!
So bloodily hast struck?
So by my former lecture and advice,
So far from cheer and from your former state,
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
So, gentlemen,
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
So crimeful and so capital in nature,
So he does indeed.
So horridly to shake our disposition
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
So levied as before, against the Polack:
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
So many journeys may the sun and moon
So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
Some little time: so by your companies
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
So much as from occasion you may glean,
So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
So much from the understanding of himself,
So, oft it chances in particular men,
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
So, proceed you.
So runs the world away.
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
So you shall;
Speak, man.
Speak loudly for him.
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
Speak; I am bound to hear.
Speak to me:
Speak to her, Hamlet.
Speak to me:
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
Stabs KING CLAUDIUS
Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
Stick fiery off indeed.
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
Stood challenger on mount of all the age
Still better, and worse.
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
Such an act
Such was the very armour he had on
Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
Swear by my sword.
Swear by my sword.
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
Takes the skull
Take them in.
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
Than is my deed to my most painted word:
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
Thanks, dear my lord.
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Than to entreaty.
Than your particular demands will touch it:
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
That I am guiltless of your father's death,
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
That I essentially am not in madness,
Take these again; for to the noble mind
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
That I must call't in question.
That I must be their scourge and minister.
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
That I have longed long to re-deliver;
That are but mutes or audience to this act,
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
That are so fortified against our story
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
That, being of so young days brought up with him,
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
That both the worlds I give to negligence,
That can I;
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
That capability and god-like reason
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.
That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
That ever I was born to set it right!
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
That from her working all his visage wann'd,
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
That I might be the organ.
That has no relish of salvation in't;
That guilty creatures sitting at a play
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
That hath made him mad.
That hath in it no profit but the name.
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
That he could nothing do but wish and beg
That he is open to incontinency;
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
That he which hath your noble father slain
That he should weep for her? What would he do,
That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should
That if again this apparition come,
That is Laertes,
That is most certain.
That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
That it might please you to give quiet pass
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
That lend a tyrannous and damned light
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
That live and feed upon your majesty.
That looks so many fathoms to the sea
That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
That makes calamity of so long life;
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
That might your nature, honour and exception
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
That our devices still are overthrown;
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is
That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
That she should lock herself from his resort,
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:
That show of such an exercise may colour
That so his sickness, age and impotence
That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
That's two of his weapons: but, well.
That's very true, my lord.
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
That they do know my son, come you more nearer
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
That they may seem the taints of liberty,
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
That thou so many princes at a shot
That to Laertes I forgot myself;
That thus he suffers for.
That to the use of actions fair and good
That treason can but peep to what it would,
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
That was and is the question of these wars.
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
That we can let our beard be shook with danger
That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
That we find out the cause of this effect,
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
That you do bend your eye on vacancy
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
That you know aught of me: this not to do,
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
That youth and observation copied there;
That your good beauties be the happy cause
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave
The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
The bell then beating one,--
The associates tend, and every thing is bent
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
The better to beguile. This is for all:
The body is with the king, but the king is not with
The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
The bold winds speechless and the orb below
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
The cat will mew and dog will have his day.
The actors are come hither, my lord.
The changeling never known. Now, the next day
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
The corse they follow did with desperate hand
The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
The devil himself.
The doors are broke.
The devil take thy soul!
The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
The effect of what I wrote?
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
The hart ungalled play;
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
The head and source of all your son's distemper.
The head is not more native to the heart,
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
The insolence of office and the spurns
The instances that second marriage move
The instant burst of clamour that she made,
The inward service of the mind and soul
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
The important acting of your dread command? O, say!
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
The king and queen and all are coming down.
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
The king my father!
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
The king rises.
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
The king, sir,--
The lady protests too much, methinks.
The light and careless livery that it wears
The leperous distilment; whose effect
The lists and full proportions, are all made
The lives of many. The cease of majesty
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
'The mobled queen?'
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
Then came each actor on his ass,--
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
The need we have to use you did provoke
The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
Then is the world one.
Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool
Then I would you were so honest a man.
Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
Then, venom, to thy work.
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
Then saw you not his face?
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The ocean, overpeering of his list,
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The origin and commencement of his grief
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
The point!--envenom'd too!
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?
The rather, if you could devise it so
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
The ratifiers and props of every word,
There are the players.
Therefore I have entreated him along
There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
Therefore let's follow.
There is a play to-night before the king;
There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
There lives within the very flame of love
There is no shuffling, there the action lies
There, my lord.
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
The queen desires you to use some gentle
There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
There's another: why may not that be the skull of a
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
There's no offence, my lord.
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,
There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
There with fantastic garlands did she come
There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
The safety and health of this whole state;
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
These hands are not more like.
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
These tedious old fools!
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
The soldiers' music and the rites of war
The single and peculiar life is bound,
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
The sight is dismal;
The source of this our watch and the chief head
The terms of our estate may not endure
The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
The tedious day with sleep.
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
The triumph of his pledge.
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
The unseen good old man.
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
The very same.
The very place puts toys of desperation,
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
The violence of either grief or joy
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
The which he loved passing well.'
The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
They are of Norway, sir.
They bore him barefaced on the bier;
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
They had begun the play--I sat me down,
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
They play
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
They play
They prepare to play
They shall go far with little.
They swear
They retire without the door
They were given me by Claudio; he received them
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
They play
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
Think it no more;
'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
This?
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
This bodiless creation ecstasy
This business is well ended.
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
This grave shall have a living monument:
This heavy-headed revel east and west
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
This is mere madness:
They are not near my conscience; their defeat
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
This is the very ecstasy of love,
This is too heavy, let me see another.
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
This is too long.
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
This mad young man: but so much was our love,
This marvel to you.
This man shall set me packing:
This must be known; which, being kept close, might
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
This night to play before him.
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
This presence knows,
This realm dismantled was
This nothing's more than matter.
This something-settled matter in his heart,
This the very coinage of your brain:
This to your majesty; this to the queen.
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
This warlike volley.
This sudden sending him away must seem
This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Thou comest in such a questionable shape
'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
This present object made probation.
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
Though inclination be as sharp as will:
Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
Thou know'st already.
Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Thou pray'st not well.
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
Through your dominions for this enterprise,
Throws up another skull
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
'Thus didest thou.'
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
Thy natural magic and dire property,
Thy loving father, Hamlet.
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
Thy knotted and combined locks to part
'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
'Tis gone!
'Tis brief, my lord.
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,
'Tis here!
'Tis here!
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
Tis now the very witching time of night,
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
'Tis strange.
'Tis most true:
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage
'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
'Tis very strange.
To England send him, or confine him where
[To KING CLAUDIUS] O, ho! do you mark that?
Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
[To POLONIUS] God save you, sir!
To POLONIUS
To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
To be, or not to be, that is the question,
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To both your honours.
To business with the king, more than the scope
To any pastime?
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,
To cut his throat i' the church.
To LAERTES
To desperation turn my trust and hope!
To OPHELIA
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
To be your Valentine.
Together with that fair and warlike form
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
To give it due content.
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
To give the world assurance of a man:
To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
To give these mourning duties to your father:
To hear and see the matter.
To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
To hear of it: they are about the court,
To hear him so inclined.
To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:
To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
To heaven.
To him from whom you brought them.
To his confine: and of the truth herein
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
To his own scandal.
To his unmaster'd importunity.
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
To keep it from divulging, let it feed
To keep those many many bodies safe
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
To lay our service freely at your feet,
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
To let this canker of our nature come
To let you know of it.
To keep itself from noyance; but much more
To make it truster of your own report
To make oppression bitter, or ere this
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
To mine own room again; making so bold,
To be commanded.
To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
To muddy death.
To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
To punish me with this and this with me,
To show his grief: let her be round with him;
To show my duty in your coronation,
To show us so much gentry and good will
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
To show yourself your father's son in deed
To sing a requiem and such rest to her
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
To some Attendants
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
To take him in the purging of his soul,
To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
To tell my story.
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!

'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most

To the inheritance of Fortinbras,

To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,

To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
To the unsatisfied.
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
To what I shall unfold.
To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may
To those of mine!
To what end, my lord?
To whom do you speak this?
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
To offer it the show of violence;
To you alone.
Treason! treason!
To you in satisfaction; but if not,
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
To you yourself, to us, to every one.
Truly to speak, and with no addition,
Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within
Truly deliver.
Try what repentance can: what can it not?
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
Upon my sword.

Upon the talk of the poisoning?

We cannot get from him.
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
We go to gain a little patch of ground

We have sworn, my lord, already.
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
Welcome, my good friends!
Weigh what convenience both of time and means

Well, God-a-mercy.
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
Well; again.
Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's
Well be with you, gentlemen!

Well, good night.

We think not so, my lord.
We will ourselves provide:
We will haste us.
What?
We will, we will.
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
What I have said to you.
What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
What are they that would speak with me?
What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the

What ceremony else?

What ceremony else?
What did you enact?
What does this mean, my lord?
What do you call the play?
We will, my lord.
What do you read, my lord?
What dost you mean by this?

What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
What follows, then, my lord?

What is the cause, Laertes,
What is the issue of the business there.
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
What is the matter, my lord?
What is the matter?
What is the reason that you use me thus?

What speech, my lord?
What's the matter now?

What's that, my lord?
What think you on't?
What thou hast said to me.
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
What warlike noise is this?
What we have two nights seen.
What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
What would she have?
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
What woman, then?
When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
When down her weedy trophies and herself
When he himself might his quietus make
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
When it proved otherwise?
When in your motion you are hot and dry--
When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
When second husband kisses me in bed.
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
When sorrows come, they come not single spies
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
When thou liest howling.
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
Wherefore should you do this?
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
When we would bring him on to some confession
Where is my father?
Where is Polonius?
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.
When in one line two crafts directly meet.
Where is this sight?
Where is your son?
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
Where, my lord?
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
Where's your father?
Where should we have our thanks?
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
Which I have told thee of my father's death:
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures
Which bewept to the grave did go
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
Where you may see the inmost part of you.
Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
Which have solicited. The rest is silence.
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Which is not tomb enough and continent
Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
Which now goes too free-footed.
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
Which was declining on the milky head
Which was the model of that Danish seal;
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
White his shroud as the mountain snow,--
Who, I?
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Who commands them, sir?
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
Who hath relieved you?
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
Who is to be buried in't?
Who is't that can inform me?
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
Whose violent property fordoes itself
Whose was it?
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
Who's there?
Who shall stay you?
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
Why,
Why,
Why I will fight with him upon this theme
Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
Why?
Why ask you this?
Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and
Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
Why, he had none.
Why does the drum come hither?
Why he more than another?
Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man
Why, how now, Hamlet!
Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
Why, right; you are i' the right;
Why seems it so particular with thee?
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Why, now you speak
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.
Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.
Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that
Why, 'tis found so.
Why to a public count I might not go,
Why, what a king is this!
Why this same strict and most observant watch
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
Why, what should be the fear?
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
Why you proceeded not against these feats,
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Will not debate the question of this straw:
Will he tell us what this show meant?
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
Will nothing stick our person to arraign
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
Will you be ruled by me?
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been
Will you know them then?
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
Will you two help to hasten them?
Wilt please you go, my lord?
Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
Winner and loser?
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
With all my imperfections on my head:
With all my love I do commend me to you:
With all the strength and armour of the mind,
With all my heart; and it doth much content me
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
With an entreaty, herein further shown,
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
With drink, sir?
With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
[Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
[Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
[Within] Heaven secure him!
[Within] Lord Hamlet,--
[Within] Let her come in.
[Within] Mother, mother, mother!
[Within] My lord, my lord,--
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Within the centre.
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
Without debatement further, more or less,
Without more motive, into every brain
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
Without the sensible and true avouch
With sore distraction. What I have done,
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
With true-love showers.
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
With this regard their currents turn awry,
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
With variable objects shall expel
With what, i' the name of God?
With windlasses and with assays of bias,
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
Witness this army of such mass and charge
Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
Words, words, words.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if
Would have reverted to my bow again,
Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,

Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.

Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes

Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
Go on; I'll follow thee.
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee

Should be as moral as an old man's life?

You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;

And prey on garbage.
His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.
Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
How much I had to do to calm his rage!
By heaven, it is as proper to our age
You cannot call it love; for at your age
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
The triumph of his pledge.
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.

We may of their encounter frankly judge,
Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;

That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
'Tis strange.
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange

'Tis very strange.

Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love

ACT I
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO
BERNARDO
Who's there?
FRANCISCO
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
BERNARDO
Long live the king!
FRANCISCO
Bernardo?
BERNARDO
He.
FRANCISCO
You come most carefully upon your hour.
BERNARDO
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
FRANCISCO
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.
BERNARDO
Have you had quiet guard?
FRANCISCO
Not a mouse stirring.
BERNARDO
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
FRANCISCO
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS

HORATIO
Friends to this ground.
MARCELLUS
And liegemen to the Dane.
FRANCISCO
Give you good night.
MARCELLUS
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Who hath relieved you?
FRANCISCO
Bernardo has my place.
Give you good night.
Exit

MARCELLUS
Holla! Bernardo!
BERNARDO
Say,
What, is Horatio there?
HORATIO
A piece of him.
BERNARDO
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
MARCELLUS
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
BERNARDO
I have seen nothing.
MARCELLUS
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
That if again this apparition come,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
HORATIO
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
BERNARDO
Sit down awhile;
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story
What we have two nights seen.
HORATIO
Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
BERNARDO
Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one,--
Enter Ghost

MARCELLUS
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
BERNARDO
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
MARCELLUS
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
BERNARDO
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
HORATIO
Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
BERNARDO
It would be spoke to.
MARCELLUS
Question it, Horatio.
HORATIO
What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
Together with that fair and warlike form
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
MARCELLUS
It is offended.
BERNARDO
See, it stalks away!
HORATIO
Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
Exit Ghost

MARCELLUS
'Tis gone, and will not answer.
BERNARDO
How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
Is not this something more than fantasy?
What think you on't?
HORATIO
Before my God, I might not this believe
Without the sensible and true avouch
Of mine own eyes.
MARCELLUS
Is it not like the king?
HORATIO
As thou art to thyself:
Such was the very armour he had on
When he the ambitious Norway combated;
So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
'Tis strange.
MARCELLUS
Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
HORATIO
In what particular thought to work I know not;
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
MARCELLUS
Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
Why this same strict and most observant watch
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
And foreign mart for implements of war;
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
Who is't that can inform me?
HORATIO
That can I;
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
Against the which, a moiety competent
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
And carriage of the article design'd,
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
For food and diet, to some enterprise
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
As it doth well appear unto our state--
But to recover of us, by strong hand
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
The source of this our watch and the chief head
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
BERNARDO
I think it be no other but e'en so:
Well may it sort that this portentous figure
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
That was and is the question of these wars.
HORATIO
A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
As harbingers preceding still the fates
And prologue to the omen coming on,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
Re-enter Ghost

I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
Speak to me:
If there be any good thing to be done,
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
Speak to me:
Cock crows

If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
MARCELLUS
Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
HORATIO
Do, if it will not stand.
BERNARDO
'Tis here!
HORATIO
'Tis here!
MARCELLUS
'Tis gone!
Exit Ghost

We do it wrong, being so majestical,
To offer it the show of violence;
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
BERNARDO
It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
HORATIO
And then it started like a guilty thing
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
The extravagant and erring spirit hies
To his confine: and of the truth herein
This present object made probation.
MARCELLUS
It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
HORATIO
So have I heard and do in part believe it.
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
MARCELLUS
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Where we shall find him most conveniently.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants
KING CLAUDIUS
Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
Together with remembrance of ourselves.
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
Importing the surrender of those lands
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
His further gait herein; in that the levies,
The lists and full proportions, are all made
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
Giving to you no further personal power
To business with the king, more than the scope
Of these delated articles allow.
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND
In that and all things will we show our duty.
KING CLAUDIUS
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS

And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
The head is not more native to the heart,
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
LAERTES
My dread lord,
Your leave and favour to return to France;
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
To show my duty in your coronation,
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
KING CLAUDIUS
Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
LORD POLONIUS
He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
By laboursome petition, and at last
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
KING CLAUDIUS
Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
HAMLET
[Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
KING CLAUDIUS
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
HAMLET
Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
Passing through nature to eternity.
HAMLET
Ay, madam, it is common.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
If it be,
Why seems it so particular with thee?
HAMLET
Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
For they are actions that a man might play:
But I have that within which passeth show;
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
KING CLAUDIUS
'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
To give these mourning duties to your father:
But, you must know, your father lost a father;
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
In filial obligation for some term
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
In obstinate condolement is a course
Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
An understanding simple and unschool'd:
For what we know must be and is as common
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
To reason most absurd: whose common theme
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
As of a father: for let the world take note,
You are the most immediate to our throne;
And with no less nobility of love
Than that which dearest father bears his son,
Do I impart toward you. For your intent
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
It is most retrograde to our desire:
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
HAMLET
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
KING CLAUDIUS
Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
Exeunt all but HAMLET

HAMLET
O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
So excellent a king; that was, to this,
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
As if increase of appetite had grown
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
A little month, or ere those shoes were old
With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
My father's brother, but no more like my father
Than I to Hercules: within a month:
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
It is not nor it cannot come to good:
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO

HORATIO
Hail to your lordship!
HAMLET
I am glad to see you well:
Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
HORATIO
The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
HAMLET
Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
MARCELLUS
My good lord--
HAMLET
I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
HORATIO
A truant disposition, good my lord.
HAMLET
I would not hear your enemy say so,
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
To make it truster of your own report
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
HORATIO
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
HAMLET
I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
HORATIO
Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
HAMLET
Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
My father!--methinks I see my father.
HORATIO
Where, my lord?
HAMLET
In my mind's eye, Horatio.
HORATIO
I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
HAMLET
He was a man, take him for all in all,
I shall not look upon his like again.
HORATIO
My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
HAMLET
Saw? who?
HORATIO
My lord, the king your father.
HAMLET
The king my father!
HORATIO
Season your admiration for awhile
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
This marvel to you.
HAMLET
For God's love, let me hear.
HORATIO
Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
In the dead vast and middle of the night,
Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Appears before them, and with solemn march
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
The apparition comes: I knew your father;
These hands are not more like.
HAMLET
But where was this?
MARCELLUS
My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
HAMLET
Did you not speak to it?
HORATIO
My lord, I did;
But answer made it none: yet once methought
It lifted up its head and did address
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
And vanish'd from our sight.
HAMLET
'Tis very strange.
HORATIO
As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
And we did think it writ down in our duty
To let you know of it.
HAMLET
Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
Hold you the watch to-night?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
We do, my lord.
HAMLET
Arm'd, say you?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
Arm'd, my lord.
HAMLET
From top to toe?
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
My lord, from head to foot.
HAMLET
Then saw you not his face?
HORATIO
O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
HAMLET
What, look'd he frowningly?
HORATIO
A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
HAMLET
Pale or red?
HORATIO
Nay, very pale.
HAMLET
And fix'd his eyes upon you?
HORATIO
Most constantly.
HAMLET
I would I had been there.
HORATIO
It would have much amazed you.
HAMLET
Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
HORATIO
While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
MARCELLUS BERNARDO
Longer, longer.
HORATIO
Not when I saw't.
HAMLET
His beard was grizzled--no?
HORATIO
It was, as I have seen it in his life,
A sable silver'd.
HAMLET
I will watch to-night;
Perchance 'twill walk again.
HORATIO
I warrant it will.
HAMLET
If it assume my noble father's person,
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
I'll visit you.
All
Our duty to your honour.
HAMLET
Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
Exeunt all but HAMLET

My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Exit

SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.
Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA
LAERTES
My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
But let me hear from you.
OPHELIA
Do you doubt that?
LAERTES
For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
A violet in the youth of primy nature,
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
OPHELIA
No more but so?
LAERTES
Think it no more;
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
The inward service of the mind and soul
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
For he himself is subject to his birth:
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
The safety and health of this whole state;
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
Unto the voice and yielding of that body
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
As he in his particular act and place
May give his saying deed; which is no further
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
To his unmaster'd importunity.
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
The canker galls the infants of the spring,
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
OPHELIA
I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
And recks not his own rede.
LAERTES
O, fear me not.
I stay too long: but here my father comes.
Enter POLONIUS

A double blessing is a double grace,
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
LORD POLONIUS
Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
And these few precepts in thy memory
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
And they in France of the best rank and station
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all: to thine ownself be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
LAERTES
Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
LAERTES
Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
What I have said to you.
OPHELIA
'Tis in my memory lock'd,
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
LAERTES
Farewell.
Exit

LORD POLONIUS
What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
OPHELIA
So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
LORD POLONIUS
Marry, well bethought:
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
Given private time to you; and you yourself
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
You do not understand yourself so clearly
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
What is between you? give me up the truth.
OPHELIA
He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
Of his affection to me.
LORD POLONIUS
Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
OPHELIA
I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
LORD POLONIUS
Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
OPHELIA
My lord, he hath importuned me with love
In honourable fashion.
LORD POLONIUS
Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
OPHELIA
And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
LORD POLONIUS
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
You must not take for fire. From this time
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
Believe so much in him, that he is young
And with a larger tether may he walk
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
Not of that dye which their investments show,
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
The better to beguile. This is for all:
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
Have you so slander any moment leisure,
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
OPHELIA
I shall obey, my lord.
Exeunt

SCENE IV. The platform.
Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS
HAMLET
The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
HORATIO
It is a nipping and an eager air.
HAMLET
What hour now?
HORATIO
I think it lacks of twelve.
HAMLET
No, it is struck.
HORATIO
Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within

What does this mean, my lord?
HAMLET
The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
The triumph of his pledge.
HORATIO
Is it a custom?
HAMLET
Ay, marry, is't:
But to my mind, though I am native here
And to the manner born, it is a custom
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
This heavy-headed revel east and west
Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
So, oft it chances in particular men,
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
Since nature cannot choose his origin--
By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
The form of plausive manners, that these men,
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
As infinite as man may undergo--
Shall in the general censure take corruption
From that particular fault: the dram of eale
Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
To his own scandal.
HORATIO
Look, my lord, it comes!
Enter Ghost

HAMLET
Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Thou comest in such a questionable shape
That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
So horridly to shake our disposition
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
Ghost beckons HAMLET

HORATIO
It beckons you to go away with it,
As if it some impartment did desire
To you alone.
MARCELLUS
Look, with what courteous action
It waves you to a more removed ground:
But do not go with it.
HORATIO
No, by no means.
HAMLET
It will not speak; then I will follow it.
HORATIO
Do not, my lord.
HAMLET
Why, what should be the fear?
I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
Being a thing immortal as itself?
It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
HORATIO
What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
And there assume some other horrible form,
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
And draw you into madness? think of it:
The very place puts toys of desperation,
Without more motive, into every brain
That looks so many fathoms to the sea
And hears it roar beneath.
HAMLET
It waves me still.
Go on; I'll follow thee.
MARCELLUS
You shall not go, my lord.
HAMLET
Hold off your hands.
HORATIO
Be ruled; you shall not go.
HAMLET
My fate cries out,
And makes each petty artery in this body
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET

HORATIO
He waxes desperate with imagination.
MARCELLUS
Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
HORATIO
Have after. To what issue will this come?
MARCELLUS
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
HORATIO
Heaven will direct it.
MARCELLUS
Nay, let's follow him.
Exeunt

SCENE V. Another part of the platform.
Enter GHOST and HAMLET
HAMLET
Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
Ghost
Mark me.
HAMLET
I will.
Ghost
My hour is almost come,
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
Must render up myself.
HAMLET
Alas, poor ghost!
Ghost
Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
To what I shall unfold.
HAMLET
Speak; I am bound to hear.
Ghost
So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
HAMLET
What?
Ghost
I am thy father's spirit,
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
Thy knotted and combined locks to part
And each particular hair to stand on end,
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
But this eternal blazon must not be
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
HAMLET
O God!
Ghost
Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
HAMLET
Murder!
Ghost
Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
HAMLET
Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
May sweep to my revenge.
Ghost
I find thee apt;
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
Is by a forged process of my death
Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
Now wears his crown.
HAMLET
O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
Ghost
Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
From me, whose love was of that dignity
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
I made to her in marriage, and to decline
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
To those of mine!
But virtue, as it never will be moved,
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
And prey on garbage.
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
My custom always of the afternoon,
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
And in the porches of my ears did pour
The leperous distilment; whose effect
Holds such an enmity with blood of man
That swift as quicksilver it courses through
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
And with a sudden vigour doth posset
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
All my smooth body.
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
No reckoning made, but sent to my account
With all my imperfections on my head:
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
A couch for luxury and damned incest.
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
Exit

HAMLET
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
Yea, from the table of my memory
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
That youth and observation copied there;
And thy commandment all alone shall live
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
O most pernicious woman!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
Writing

So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
I have sworn 't.
MARCELLUS HORATIO
[Within] My lord, my lord,--
MARCELLUS
[Within] Lord Hamlet,--
HORATIO
[Within] Heaven secure him!
HAMLET
So be it!
HORATIO
[Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
HAMLET
Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS

MARCELLUS
How is't, my noble lord?
HORATIO
What news, my lord?
HAMLET
O, wonderful!
HORATIO
Good my lord, tell it.
HAMLET
No; you'll reveal it.
HORATIO
Not I, my lord, by heaven.
MARCELLUS
Nor I, my lord.
HAMLET
How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
But you'll be secret?
HORATIO MARCELLUS
Ay, by heaven, my lord.
HAMLET
There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
But he's an arrant knave.
HORATIO
There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
To tell us this.
HAMLET
Why, right; you are i' the right;
And so, without more circumstance at all,
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
You, as your business and desire shall point you;
For every man has business and desire,
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
Look you, I'll go pray.
HORATIO
These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
HAMLET
I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
Yes, 'faith heartily.
HORATIO
There's no offence, my lord.
HAMLET
Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
For your desire to know what is between us,
O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
Give me one poor request.
HORATIO
What is't, my lord? we will.
HAMLET
Never make known what you have seen to-night.
HORATIO MARCELLUS
My lord, we will not.
HAMLET
Nay, but swear't.
HORATIO
In faith,
My lord, not I.
MARCELLUS
Nor I, my lord, in faith.
HAMLET
Upon my sword.
MARCELLUS
We have sworn, my lord, already.
HAMLET
Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
Ghost
[Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET
Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
truepenny?
Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
Consent to swear.
HORATIO
Propose the oath, my lord.
HAMLET
Never to speak of this that you have seen,
Swear by my sword.
Ghost
[Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET
Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
Come hither, gentlemen,
And lay your hands again upon my sword:
Never to speak of this that you have heard,
Swear by my sword.
Ghost
[Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET
Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
HORATIO
O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
HAMLET
And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
To put an antic disposition on,
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
That you know aught of me: this not to do,
So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.
Ghost
[Beneath] Swear.
HAMLET
Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
They swear

So, gentlemen,
With all my love I do commend me to you:
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
May do, to express his love and friending to you,
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
That ever I was born to set it right!
Nay, come, let's go together.
Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. A room in POLONIUS' house.
Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO
LORD POLONIUS
Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
REYNALDO
I will, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
Before you visit him, to make inquire
Of his behavior.
REYNALDO
My lord, I did intend it.
LORD POLONIUS
Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
What company, at what expense; and finding
By this encompassment and drift of question
That they do know my son, come you more nearer
Than your particular demands will touch it:
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
REYNALDO
Ay, very well, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
As are companions noted and most known
To youth and liberty.
REYNALDO
As gaming, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
Drabbing: you may go so far.
REYNALDO
My lord, that would dishonour him.
LORD POLONIUS
'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
You must not put another scandal on him,
That he is open to incontinency;
That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
That they may seem the taints of liberty,
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
Of general assault.
REYNALDO
But, my good lord,--
LORD POLONIUS
Wherefore should you do this?
REYNALDO
Ay, my lord,
I would know that.
LORD POLONIUS
Marry, sir, here's my drift;
And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
You laying these slight sullies on my son,
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
Your party in converse, him you would sound,
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
He closes with you in this consequence;
'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
According to the phrase or the addition
Of man and country.
REYNALDO
Very good, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
something: where did I leave?
REYNALDO
At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
and 'gentleman.'
LORD POLONIUS
At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
See you now;
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
With windlasses and with assays of bias,
By indirections find directions out:
So by my former lecture and advice,
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
REYNALDO
My lord, I have.
LORD POLONIUS
God be wi' you; fare you well.
REYNALDO
Good my lord!
LORD POLONIUS
Observe his inclination in yourself.
REYNALDO
I shall, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
And let him ply his music.
REYNALDO
Well, my lord.
LORD POLONIUS
Farewell!
Exit REYNALDO

Enter OPHELIA

How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
OPHELIA
O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
LORD POLONIUS
With what, i' the name of God?
OPHELIA
My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
And with a look so piteous in purport
As if he had been loosed out of hell
To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
LORD POLONIUS
Mad for thy love?
OPHELIA
My lord, I do not know;
But truly, I do fear it.
LORD POLONIUS
What said he?
OPHELIA
He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
He falls to such perusal of my face
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
At last, a little shaking of mine arm
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
For out o' doors he went without their helps,
And, to the last, bended their light on me.
LORD POLONIUS
Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
This is the very ecstasy of love,
Whose violent property fordoes itself
And leads the will to desperate undertakings
As oft as any passion under heaven
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
What, have you given him any hard words of late?
OPHELIA
No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
I did repel his fetters and denied
His access to me.
LORD POLONIUS
That hath made him mad.
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
By heaven, it is as proper to our age
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
As it is common for the younger sort
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
This must be known; which, being kept close, might
move
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants
KING CLAUDIUS
Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
Moreover that we much did long to see you,
The need we have to use you did provoke
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
Resembles that it was. What it should be,
More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
So much from the understanding of himself,
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
That, being of so young days brought up with him,
And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
Some little time: so by your companies
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
So much as from occasion you may glean,
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
And sure I am two men there are not living
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
To show us so much gentry and good will
As to expend your time with us awhile,
For the supply and profit of our hope,
Your visitation shall receive such thanks
As fits a king's remembrance.
ROSENCRANTZ
Both your majesties
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
Put your dread pleasures more into command
Than to entreaty.
GUILDENSTERN
But we both obey,
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
To lay our service freely at your feet,
To be commanded.
KING CLAUDIUS
Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
And I beseech you instantly to visit
My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
GUILDENSTERN
Heavens make our presence and our practises
Pleasant and helpful to him!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Ay, amen!
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some Attendants

Enter POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS
The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
Are joyfully return'd.
KING CLAUDIUS
Thou still hast been the father of good news.
LORD POLONIUS
Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
Both to my God and to my gracious king:
And I do think, or else this brain of mine
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
As it hath used to do, that I have found
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
KING CLAUDIUS
O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
LORD POLONIUS
Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
KING CLAUDIUS
Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
Exit POLONIUS

He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
The head and source of all your son's distemper.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
I doubt it is no other but the main;
His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.
KING CLAUDIUS
Well, we shall sift him.
Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS

Welcome, my good friends!
Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
VOLTIMAND
Most fair return of greetings and desires.
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
But, better look'd into, he truly found
It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
That so his sickness, age and impotence
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
Makes vow before his uncle never more
To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
So levied as before, against the Polack:
With an entreaty, herein further shown,
Giving a paper

That it might please you to give quiet pass
Through your dominions for this enterprise,
On such regards of safety and allowance
As therein are set down.
KING CLAUDIUS
It likes us well;
And at our more consider'd time well read,
Answer, and think upon this business.
Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
Most welcome home!
Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS

LORD POLONIUS
This business is well ended.
My liege, and madam, to expostulate
What majesty should be, what duty is,
Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
But let that go.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
More matter, with less art.
LORD POLONIUS
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
But farewell it, for I will use no art.
Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
That we find out the cause of this effect,
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
For this effect defective comes by cause:
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
Reads

'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
beautified Ophelia,'--
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is
a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
Reads

'In her excellent white bosom, these, & c.'
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Came this from Hamlet to her?
LORD POLONIUS
Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
Reads

'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
Doubt that the sun doth move;
Doubt truth to be a liar;
But never doubt I love.
'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
this machine is to him, HAMLET.'
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
And more above, hath his solicitings,
As they fell out by time, by means and place,
All given to mine ear.
KING CLAUDIUS
But how hath she
Received his love?
LORD POLONIUS
What do you think of me?
KING CLAUDIUS
As of a man faithful and honourable.
LORD POLONIUS
I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
Before my daughter told me--what might you,
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
What might you think? No, I went round to work,
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
That she should lock herself from his resort,
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
Into the madness wherein now he raves,
And all we mourn for.
KING CLAUDIUS
Do you think 'tis this?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
It may be, very likely.
LORD POLONIUS
Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
When it proved otherwise?
KING CLAUDIUS
Not that I know.
LORD POLONIUS
[Pointing to his head and shoulder]
Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
If circumstances lead me, I will find
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
Within the centre.
KING CLAUDIUS
How may we try it further?
LORD POLONIUS
You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
Here in the lobby.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
So he does indeed.
LORD POLONIUS
At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
Be you and I behind an arras then;
Mark the encounter: if he love her not
And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
Let me be no assistant for a state,
But keep a farm and carters.
KING CLAUDIUS
We will try it.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
LORD POLONIUS
Away, I do beseech you, both away:
I'll board him presently.
Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and Attendants

Enter HAMLET, reading

O, give me leave:
How does my good Lord Hamlet?
HAMLET
Well, God-a-mercy.
LORD POLONIUS
Do you know me, my lord?
HAMLET
Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.
LORD POLONIUS
Not I, my lord.
HAMLET
Then I would you were so honest a man.
LORD POLONIUS
Honest, my lord!
HAMLET
Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
one man picked out of ten thousand.
LORD POLONIUS
That's very true, my lord.
HAMLET
For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?
LORD POLONIUS
I have, my lord.
HAMLET
Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
Friend, look to 't.
LORD POLONIUS
[Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my
daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I
was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
What do you read, my lord?
HAMLET
Words, words, words.
LORD POLONIUS
What is the matter, my lord?
HAMLET
Between who?
LORD POLONIUS
I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
HAMLET
Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
you could go backward.
LORD POLONIUS
[Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is method
in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
HAMLET
Into my grave.
LORD POLONIUS
Indeed, that is out o' the air.
Aside

How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of
meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable
lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
HAMLET
You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
more willingly part withal: except my life, except
my life, except my life.
LORD POLONIUS
Fare you well, my lord.
HAMLET
These tedious old fools!
Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

LORD POLONIUS
You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
ROSENCRANTZ
[To POLONIUS] God save you, sir!
Exit POLONIUS

GUILDENSTERN
My honoured lord!
ROSENCRANTZ
My most dear lord!
HAMLET
My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
ROSENCRANTZ
As the indifferent children of the earth.
GUILDENSTERN
Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
HAMLET
Nor the soles of her shoe?
ROSENCRANTZ
Neither, my lord.
HAMLET
Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
her favours?
GUILDENSTERN
'Faith, her privates we.
HAMLET
In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she
is a strumpet. What's the news?
ROSENCRANTZ
None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
HAMLET
Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
Let me question more in particular: what have you,
my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
that she sends you to prison hither?
GUILDENSTERN
Prison, my lord!
HAMLET
Denmark's a prison.
ROSENCRANTZ
Then is the world one.
HAMLET
A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
ROSENCRANTZ
We think not so, my lord.
HAMLET
Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me
it is a prison.
ROSENCRANTZ
Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
narrow for your mind.
HAMLET
O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
have bad dreams.
GUILDENSTERN
Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
HAMLET
A dream itself is but a shadow.
ROSENCRANTZ
Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
HAMLET
Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we
to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.
ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN
We'll wait upon you.
HAMLET
No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest
man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
ROSENCRANTZ
To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
HAMLET
Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
GUILDENSTERN
What should we say, my lord?
HAMLET
Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
ROSENCRANTZ
To what end, my lord?
HAMLET
That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
whether you were sent for, or no?
ROSENCRANTZ
[Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?
HAMLET
[Aside] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
love me, hold not off.
GUILDENSTERN
My lord, we were sent for.
HAMLET
I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
you seem to say so.
ROSENCRANTZ
My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
HAMLET
Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
ROSENCRANTZ
To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
coming, to offer you service.
HAMLET
He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
for't. What players are they?
ROSENCRANTZ
Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
tragedians of the city.
HAMLET
How chances it they travel? their residence, both
in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
ROSENCRANTZ
I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
late innovation.
HAMLET
Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
in the city? are they so followed?
ROSENCRANTZ
No, indeed, are they not.
HAMLET
How comes it? do they grow rusty?
ROSENCRANTZ
Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
that cry out on the top of question, and are most
tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the
fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they
call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
HAMLET
What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
longer than they can sing? will they not say
afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
players--as it is most like, if their means are no
better--their writers do them wrong, to make them
exclaim against their own succession?
ROSENCRANTZ
'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid
for argument, unless the poet and the player went to
cuffs in the question.
HAMLET
Is't possible?
GUILDENSTERN
O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
HAMLET
Do the boys carry it away?
ROSENCRANTZ
Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
HAMLET
It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an
hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
'Sblood, there is something in this more than
natural, if philosophy could find it out.
Flourish of trumpets within

GUILDENSTERN
There are the players.
HAMLET
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
must show fairly outward, should more appear like
entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
GUILDENSTERN
In what, my dear lord?
HAMLET
I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
Enter POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS
Well be with you, gentlemen!
HAMLET
Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
out of his swaddling-clouts.
ROSENCRANTZ
Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
say an old man is twice a child.
HAMLET
I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
'twas so indeed.
LORD POLONIUS
My lord, I have news to tell you.
HAMLET
My lord, I have news to tell you.
When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
LORD POLONIUS
The actors are come hither, my lord.
HAMLET
Buz, buz!
LORD POLONIUS
Upon mine honour,--
HAMLET
Then came each actor on his ass,--
LORD POLONIUS
The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
liberty, these are the only men.
HAMLET
O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
LORD POLONIUS
What a treasure had he, my lord?
HAMLET
Why,
'One fair daughter and no more,
The which he loved passing well.'
LORD POLONIUS
[Aside] Still on my daughter.
HAMLET
Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
LORD POLONIUS
If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
that I love passing well.
HAMLET
Nay, that follows not.
LORD POLONIUS
What follows, then, my lord?
HAMLET
Why,
'As by lot, God wot,'
and then, you know,
'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
the first row of the pious chanson will show you
more; for look, where my abridgement comes.
Enter four or five Players

You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
of your quality; come, a passionate speech.
First Player
What speech, my lord?
HAMLET
I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
digested in the scenes, set down with as much
modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
indict the author of affectation; but called it an
honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
at this line: let me see, let me see--
'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
That lend a tyrannous and damned light
To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
So, proceed you.
LORD POLONIUS
'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
good discretion.
First Player
'Anon he finds him
Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
Which was declining on the milky head
Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
And like a neutral to his will and matter,
Did nothing.
But, as we often see, against some storm,
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
The bold winds speechless and the orb below
As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
Now falls on Priam.
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
In general synod 'take away her power;
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
As low as to the fiends!'
LORD POLONIUS
This is too long.
HAMLET
It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.
First Player
'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'
HAMLET
'The mobled queen?'
LORD POLONIUS
That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.
First Player
'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
pronounced:
But if the gods themselves did see her then
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
The instant burst of clamour that she made,
Unless things mortal move them not at all,
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
And passion in the gods.'
LORD POLONIUS
Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.
HAMLET
'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
Good my lord, will you see the players well
bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for
they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
time: after your death you were better have a bad
epitaph than their ill report while you live.
LORD POLONIUS
My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
HAMLET
God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man
after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
Take them in.
LORD POLONIUS
Come, sirs.
HAMLET
Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First

Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the
Murder of Gonzago?
First Player
Ay, my lord.
HAMLET
We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
First Player
Ay, my lord.
HAMLET
Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him
not.
Exit First Player

My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
welcome to Elsinore.
ROSENCRANTZ
Good my lord!
HAMLET
Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Now I am alone.
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
Could force his soul so to his own conceit
That from her working all his visage wann'd,
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
For Hecuba!
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
That he should weep for her? What would he do,
Had he the motive and the cue for passion
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
Upon whose property and most dear life
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
Ha!
'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
To make oppression bitter, or ere this
I should have fatted all the region kites
With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
O, vengeance!
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
A scullion!
Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
That guilty creatures sitting at a play
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul that presently
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
Play something like the murder of my father
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
May be the devil: and the devil hath power
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
As he is very potent with such spirits,
Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
More relative than this: the play 's the thing
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

ACT III
SCENE I. A room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN
KING CLAUDIUS
And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
ROSENCRANTZ
He does confess he feels himself distracted;
But from what cause he will by no means speak.
GUILDENSTERN
Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
When we would bring him on to some confession
Of his true state.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Did he receive you well?
ROSENCRANTZ
Most like a gentleman.
GUILDENSTERN
But with much forcing of his disposition.
ROSENCRANTZ
Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
Most free in his reply.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Did you assay him?
To any pastime?
ROSENCRANTZ
Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
To hear of it: they are about the court,
And, as I think, they have already order
This night to play before him.
LORD POLONIUS
'Tis most true:
And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
To hear and see the matter.
KING CLAUDIUS
With all my heart; and it doth much content me
To hear him so inclined.
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
And drive his purpose on to these delights.
ROSENCRANTZ
We shall, my lord.
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

KING CLAUDIUS
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
Affront Ophelia:
Her father and myself, lawful espials,
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
We may of their encounter frankly judge,
And gather by him, as he is behaved,
If 't be the affliction of his love or no
That thus he suffers for.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
I shall obey you.
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
That your good beauties be the happy cause
Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
To both your honours.
OPHELIA
Madam, I wish it may.
Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE

LORD POLONIUS
Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
We will bestow ourselves.
To OPHELIA

Read on this book;
That show of such an exercise may colour
Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--
'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage
And pious action we do sugar o'er
The devil himself.
KING CLAUDIUS
[Aside] O, 'tis too true!
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
Than is my deed to my most painted word:
O heavy burthen!
LORD POLONIUS
I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS

Enter HAMLET

HAMLET
To be, or not to be, that is the question,
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause: there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
Be all my sins remember'd.
OPHELIA
Good my lord,
How does your honour for this many a day?
HAMLET
I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
OPHELIA
My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
That I have longed long to re-deliver;
I pray you, now receive them.
HAMLET
No, not I;
I never gave you aught.
OPHELIA
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
Take these again; for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.
HAMLET
Ha, ha! are you honest?
OPHELIA
My lord?
HAMLET
Are you fair?
OPHELIA
What means your lordship?
HAMLET
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should
admit no discourse to your beauty.
OPHELIA
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
with honesty?
HAMLET
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
force of honesty can translate beauty into his
likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
time gives it proof. I did love you once.
OPHELIA
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
HAMLET
You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
it: I loved you not.
OPHELIA
I was the more deceived.
HAMLET
Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
Where's your father?
OPHELIA
At home, my lord.
HAMLET
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.
OPHELIA
O, help him, you sweet heavens!
HAMLET
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a
nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs
marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
and quickly too. Farewell.
OPHELIA
O heavenly powers, restore him!
HAMLET
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God
has given you one face, and you make yourselves
another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and
nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness
your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath
made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
those that are married already, all but one, shall
live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a
nunnery, go.
Exit

OPHELIA
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS

KING CLAUDIUS
Love! his affections do not that way tend;
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
I have in quick determination
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
For the demand of our neglected tribute
Haply the seas and countries different
With variable objects shall expel
This something-settled matter in his heart,
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
LORD POLONIUS
It shall do well: but yet do I believe
The origin and commencement of his grief
Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
But, if you hold it fit, after the play
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
To show his grief: let her be round with him;
And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
Of all their conference. If she find him not,
To England send him, or confine him where
Your wisdom best shall think.
KING CLAUDIUS
It shall be so:
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A hall in the castle.
Enter HAMLET and Players
HAMLET
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
as many of your players do, I had as lief the
town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
for the most part are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.
First Player
I warrant your honour.
HAMLET
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
word to the action; with this special o'erstep not
the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
censure of the which one must in your allowance
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
players that I have seen play, and heard others
praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
First Player
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
sir.
HAMLET
O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered:
that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.
Exeunt Players

Enter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN

How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?
LORD POLONIUS
And the queen too, and that presently.
HAMLET
Bid the players make haste.
Exit POLONIUS

Will you two help to hasten them?
ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN
We will, my lord.
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

HAMLET
What ho! Horatio!
Enter HORATIO

HORATIO
Here, sweet lord, at your service.
HAMLET
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
As e'er my conversation coped withal.
HORATIO
O, my dear lord,--
HAMLET
Nay, do not think I flatter;
For what advancement may I hope from thee
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
And could of men distinguish, her election
Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
There is a play to-night before the king;
One scene of it comes near the circumstance
Which I have told thee of my father's death:
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
Even with the very comment of thy soul
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
And my imaginations are as foul
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
And after we will both our judgments join
In censure of his seeming.
HORATIO
Well, my lord:
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
HAMLET
They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
Get you a place.
Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others

KING CLAUDIUS
How fares our cousin Hamlet?
HAMLET
Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
KING CLAUDIUS
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
are not mine.
HAMLET
No, nor mine now.
To POLONIUS

My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?
LORD POLONIUS
That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.
HAMLET
What did you enact?
LORD POLONIUS
I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
Capitol; Brutus killed me.
HAMLET
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be the players ready?
ROSENCRANTZ
Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
HAMLET
No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
LORD POLONIUS
[To KING CLAUDIUS] O, ho! do you mark that?
HAMLET
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
Lying down at OPHELIA's feet

OPHELIA
No, my lord.
HAMLET
I mean, my head upon your lap?
OPHELIA
Ay, my lord.
HAMLET
Do you think I meant country matters?
OPHELIA
I think nothing, my lord.
HAMLET
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
OPHELIA
What is, my lord?
HAMLET
Nothing.
OPHELIA
You are merry, my lord.
HAMLET
Who, I?
OPHELIA
Ay, my lord.
HAMLET
O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do
but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my
mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
OPHELIA
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
HAMLET
So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's
hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half
a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with
the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,
the hobby-horse is forgot.'
Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters

Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love

Exeunt

OPHELIA
What means this, my lord?
HAMLET
Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
OPHELIA
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
Enter Prologue

HAMLET
We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot
keep counsel; they'll tell all.
OPHELIA
Will he tell us what this show meant?
HAMLET
Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you
ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
OPHELIA
You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
Prologue
For us, and for our tragedy,
Here stooping to your clemency,
We beg your hearing patiently.
Exit

HAMLET
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
OPHELIA
'Tis brief, my lord.
HAMLET
As woman's love.
Enter two Players, King and Queen

Player King
Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
About the world have times twelve thirties been,
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
Player Queen
So many journeys may the sun and moon
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
So far from cheer and from your former state,
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
For women's fear and love holds quantity;
In neither aught, or in extremity.
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
Player King
'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
My operant powers their functions leave to do:
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind
For husband shalt thou--
Player Queen
O, confound the rest!
Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
In second husband let me be accurst!
None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
HAMLET
[Aside] Wormwood, wormwood.
Player Queen
The instances that second marriage move
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
A second time I kill my husband dead,
When second husband kisses me in bed.
Player King
I do believe you think what now you speak;
But what we do determine oft we break.
Purpose is but the slave to memory,
Of violent birth, but poor validity;
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
Most necessary 'tis that we forget
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The violence of either grief or joy
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
Directly seasons him his enemy.
But, orderly to end where I begun,
Our wills and fates do so contrary run
That our devices still are overthrown;
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
Player Queen
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
To desperation turn my trust and hope!
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
HAMLET
If she should break it now!
Player King
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
The tedious day with sleep.
Sleeps

Player Queen
Sleep rock thy brain,
And never come mischance between us twain!
Exit

HAMLET
Madam, how like you this play?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
The lady protests too much, methinks.
HAMLET
O, but she'll keep her word.
KING CLAUDIUS
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
HAMLET
No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
i' the world.
KING CLAUDIUS
What do you call the play?
HAMLET
The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is
the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see
anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'
that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our
withers are unwrung.
Enter LUCIANUS

This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
OPHELIA
You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
HAMLET
I could interpret between you and your love, if I
could see the puppets dallying.
OPHELIA
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
HAMLET
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
OPHELIA
Still better, and worse.
HAMLET
So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'
LUCIANUS
Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
Thy natural magic and dire property,
On wholesome life usurp immediately.
Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears

HAMLET
He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His
name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in
choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer
gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
OPHELIA
The king rises.
HAMLET
What, frighted with false fire!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
How fares my lord?
LORD POLONIUS
Give o'er the play.
KING CLAUDIUS
Give me some light: away!
All
Lights, lights, lights!
Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIO

HAMLET
Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
The hart ungalled play;
For some must watch, while some must sleep:
So runs the world away.
Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if
the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two
Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a
fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
HORATIO
Half a share.
HAMLET
A whole one, I.
For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
This realm dismantled was
Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
A very, very--pajock.
HORATIO
You might have rhymed.
HAMLET
O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a
thousand pound. Didst perceive?
HORATIO
Very well, my lord.
HAMLET
Upon the talk of the poisoning?
HORATIO
I did very well note him.
HAMLET
Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
For if the king like not the comedy,
Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
Come, some music!
Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

GUILDENSTERN
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
HAMLET
Sir, a whole history.
GUILDENSTERN
The king, sir,--
HAMLET
Ay, sir, what of him?
GUILDENSTERN
Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
HAMLET
With drink, sir?
GUILDENSTERN
No, my lord, rather with choler.
HAMLET
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him
to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
more choler.
GUILDENSTERN
Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
start not so wildly from my affair.
HAMLET
I am tame, sir: pronounce.
GUILDENSTERN
The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit, hath sent me to you.
HAMLET
You are welcome.
GUILDENSTERN
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed. If it shall please you to make me a
wholesome answer, I will do your mother's
commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
shall be the end of my business.
HAMLET
Sir, I cannot.
GUILDENSTERN
What, my lord?
HAMLET
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;
or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no
more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--
ROSENCRANTZ
Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
into amazement and admiration.
HAMLET
O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's
admiration? Impart.
ROSENCRANTZ
She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you
go to bed.
HAMLET
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have
you any further trade with us?
ROSENCRANTZ
My lord, you once did love me.
HAMLET
So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
ROSENCRANTZ
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you
do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if
you deny your griefs to your friend.
HAMLET
Sir, I lack advancement.
ROSENCRANTZ
How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
himself for your succession in Denmark?
HAMLET
Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
is something musty.
Re-enter Players with recorders

O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with
you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,
as if you would drive me into a toil?
GUILDENSTERN
O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.
HAMLET
I do not well understand that. Will you play upon
this pipe?
GUILDENSTERN
My lord, I cannot.
HAMLET
I pray you.
GUILDENSTERN
Believe me, I cannot.
HAMLET
I do beseech you.
GUILDENSTERN
I know no touch of it, my lord.
HAMLET
'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your
mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
Look you, these are the stops.
GUILDENSTERN
But these cannot I command to any utterance of
harmony; I have not the skill.
HAMLET
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
the top of my compass: and there is much music,
excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot
you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am
easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you
cannot play upon me.
Enter POLONIUS

God bless you, sir!
LORD POLONIUS
My lord, the queen would speak with you, and
presently.
HAMLET
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
LORD POLONIUS
By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
HAMLET
Methinks it is like a weasel.
LORD POLONIUS
It is backed like a weasel.
HAMLET
Or like a whale?
LORD POLONIUS
Very like a whale.
HAMLET
Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool
me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.
LORD POLONIUS
I will say so.
HAMLET
By and by is easily said.
Exit POLONIUS

Leave me, friends.
Exeunt all but HAMLET

Tis now the very witching time of night,
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
And do such bitter business as the day
Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
How in my words soever she be shent,
To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
Exit

SCENE III. A room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN
KING CLAUDIUS
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
And he to England shall along with you:
The terms of our estate may not endure
Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
Out of his lunacies.
GUILDENSTERN
We will ourselves provide:
Most holy and religious fear it is
To keep those many many bodies safe
That live and feed upon your majesty.
ROSENCRANTZ
The single and peculiar life is bound,
With all the strength and armour of the mind,
To keep itself from noyance; but much more
That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
The lives of many. The cease of majesty
Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw
What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
Each small annexment, petty consequence,
Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
KING CLAUDIUS
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
For we will fetters put upon this fear,
Which now goes too free-footed.
ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN
We will haste us.
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Enter POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:
And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
And tell you what I know.
KING CLAUDIUS
Thanks, dear my lord.
Exit POLONIUS

O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
Though inclination be as sharp as will:
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
And, like a man to double business bound,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
But to confront the visage of offence?
And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
Of those effects for which I did the murder,
My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
In the corrupted currents of this world
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
There is no shuffling, there the action lies
In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
Try what repentance can: what can it not?
Yet what can it when one can not repent?
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
All may be well.
Retires and kneels

Enter HAMLET

HAMLET
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;
And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
A villain kills my father; and for that,
I, his sole son, do this same villain send
To heaven.
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
He took my father grossly, full of bread;
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
But in our circumstance and course of thought,
'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,
To take him in the purging of his soul,
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
No!
Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
At gaming, swearing, or about some act
That has no relish of salvation in't;
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
Exit

KING CLAUDIUS
[Rising] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
Exit

SCENE IV. The Queen's closet.
Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE and POLONIUS
LORD POLONIUS
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
Pray you, be round with him.
HAMLET
[Within] Mother, mother, mother!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
I'll warrant you,
Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.
POLONIUS hides behind the arras

Enter HAMLET

HAMLET
Now, mother, what's the matter?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
HAMLET
Mother, you have my father much offended.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
HAMLET
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Why, how now, Hamlet!
HAMLET
What's the matter now?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Have you forgot me?
HAMLET
No, by the rood, not so:
You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
HAMLET
Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see the inmost part of you.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
Help, help, ho!
LORD POLONIUS
[Behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
HAMLET
[Drawing] How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!
Makes a pass through the arras

LORD POLONIUS
[Behind] O, I am slain!
Falls and dies

QUEEN GERTRUDE
O me, what hast thou done?
HAMLET
Nay, I know not:
Is it the king?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
HAMLET
A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
As kill a king!
HAMLET
Ay, lady, 'twas my word.
Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS

Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
If it be made of penetrable stuff,
If damned custom have not brass'd it so
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue
In noise so rude against me?
HAMLET
Such an act
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
From the fair forehead of an innocent love
And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows
As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
As from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
Is thought-sick at the act.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Ay me, what act,
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
HAMLET
Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
A station like the herald Mercury
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
A combination and a form indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man:
This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
You cannot call it love; for at your age
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
But it reserved some quantity of choice,
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Could not so mope.
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
Since frost itself as actively doth burn
And reason panders will.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
O Hamlet, speak no more:
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct.
HAMLET
Nay, but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
Over the nasty sty,--
QUEEN GERTRUDE
O, speak to me no more;
These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
No more, sweet Hamlet!
HAMLET
A murderer and a villain;
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
And put it in his pocket!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
No more!
HAMLET
A king of shreds and patches,--
Enter Ghost

Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Alas, he's mad!
HAMLET
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
The important acting of your dread command? O, say!
Ghost
Do not forget: this visitation
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
O, step between her and her fighting soul:
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
Speak to her, Hamlet.
HAMLET
How is it with you, lady?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Alas, how is't with you,
That you do bend your eye on vacancy
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
HAMLET
On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
Lest with this piteous action you convert
My stern effects: then what I have to do
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
To whom do you speak this?
HAMLET
Do you see nothing there?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
HAMLET
Nor did you nothing hear?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
No, nothing but ourselves.
HAMLET
Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
My father, in his habit as he lived!
Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!
Exit Ghost

QUEEN GERTRUDE
This the very coinage of your brain:
This bodiless creation ecstasy
Is very cunning in.
HAMLET
Ecstasy!
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
And I the matter will re-word; which madness
Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
For in the fatness of these pursy times
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
HAMLET
O, throw away the worser part of it,
And live the purer with the other half.
Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
That to the use of actions fair and good
He likewise gives a frock or livery,
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
And either [ ] the devil, or throw him out
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
Pointing to POLONIUS

I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
To punish me with this and this with me,
That I must be their scourge and minister.
I will bestow him, and will answer well
The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
I must be cruel, only to be kind:
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
One word more, good lady.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
What shall I do?
HAMLET
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
Make you to ravel all this matter out,
That I essentially am not in madness,
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
Unpeg the basket on the house's top.
Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
And break your own neck down.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
What thou hast said to me.
HAMLET
I must to England; you know that?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Alack,
I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
HAMLET
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
But I will delve one yard below their mines,
And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
When in one line two crafts directly meet.
This man shall set me packing:
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor
Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
Good night, mother.
Exeunt severally; HAMLET dragging in POLONIUS

ACT IV
SCENE I. A room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN
KING CLAUDIUS
There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
Where is your son?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Bestow this place on us a little while.
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
KING CLAUDIUS
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
Behind the arras hearing something stir,
Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
And, in this brainish apprehension, kills
The unseen good old man.
KING CLAUDIUS
O heavy deed!
It had been so with us, had we been there:
His liberty is full of threats to all;
To you yourself, to us, to every one.
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
It will be laid to us, whose providence
Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,
This mad young man: but so much was our love,
We would not understand what was most fit;
But, like the owner of a foul disease,
To keep it from divulging, let it feed
Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
Among a mineral of metals base,
Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.
KING CLAUDIUS
O Gertrude, come away!
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
We must, with all our majesty and skill,
Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
And let them know, both what we mean to do,
And what's untimely done. O, come away!
My soul is full of discord and dismay.
Exeunt

SCENE II. Another room in the castle.
Enter HAMLET
HAMLET
Safely stowed.
ROSENCRANTZ: GUILDENSTERN:
[Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
HAMLET
What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
O, here they come.
Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

ROSENCRANTZ
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
HAMLET
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
ROSENCRANTZ
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
And bear it to the chapel.
HAMLET
Do not believe it.
ROSENCRANTZ
Believe what?
HAMLET
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
replication should be made by the son of a king?
ROSENCRANTZ
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
HAMLET
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
king best service in the end: he keeps them, like
an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to
be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you
shall be dry again.
ROSENCRANTZ
I understand you not, my lord.
HAMLET
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
foolish ear.
ROSENCRANTZ
My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
with us to the king.
HAMLET
The body is with the king, but the king is not with
the body. The king is a thing--
GUILDENSTERN
A thing, my lord!
HAMLET
Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
Exeunt

SCENE III. Another room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attended
KING CLAUDIUS
I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
He's loved of the distracted multitude,
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
This sudden sending him away must seem
Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
By desperate appliance are relieved,
Or not at all.
Enter ROSENCRANTZ

How now! what hath befall'n?
ROSENCRANTZ
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
We cannot get from him.
KING CLAUDIUS
But where is he?
ROSENCRANTZ
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
KING CLAUDIUS
Bring him before us.
ROSENCRANTZ
Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN

KING CLAUDIUS
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
HAMLET
At supper.
KING CLAUDIUS
At supper! where?
HAMLET
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your
worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for
maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but
variable service, two dishes, but to one table:
that's the end.
KING CLAUDIUS
Alas, alas!
HAMLET
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
KING CLAUDIUS
What dost you mean by this?
HAMLET
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
progress through the guts of a beggar.
KING CLAUDIUS
Where is Polonius?
HAMLET
In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger
find him not there, seek him i' the other place
yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within
this month, you shall nose him as you go up the
stairs into the lobby.
KING CLAUDIUS
Go seek him there.
To some Attendants

HAMLET
He will stay till ye come.
Exeunt Attendants

KING CLAUDIUS
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
The associates tend, and every thing is bent
For England.
HAMLET
For England!
KING CLAUDIUS
Ay, Hamlet.
HAMLET
Good.
KING CLAUDIUS
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
HAMLET
I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for
England! Farewell, dear mother.
KING CLAUDIUS
Thy loving father, Hamlet.
HAMLET
My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man
and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
Exit

KING CLAUDIUS
Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set
Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
By letters congruing to that effect,
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
Exit

SCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.
Enter FORTINBRAS, a Captain, and Soldiers, marching
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;
Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras
Craves the conveyance of a promised march
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
If that his majesty would aught with us,
We shall express our duty in his eye;
And let him know so.
Captain
I will do't, my lord.
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
Go softly on.
Exeunt FORTINBRAS and Soldiers

Enter HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others

HAMLET
Good sir, whose powers are these?
Captain
They are of Norway, sir.
HAMLET
How purposed, sir, I pray you?
Captain
Against some part of Poland.
HAMLET
Who commands them, sir?
Captain
The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.
HAMLET
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
Or for some frontier?
Captain
Truly to speak, and with no addition,
We go to gain a little patch of ground
That hath in it no profit but the name.
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
HAMLET
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
Captain
Yes, it is already garrison'd.
HAMLET
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
Will not debate the question of this straw:
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.
Captain
God be wi' you, sir.
Exit

ROSENCRANTZ
Wilt please you go, my lord?
HAMLET
I'll be with you straight go a little before.
Exeunt all except HAMLET

How all occasions do inform against me,
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
If his chief good and market of his time
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
Looking before and after, gave us not
That capability and god-like reason
To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
Of thinking too precisely on the event,
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
And ever three parts coward, I do not know
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
Witness this army of such mass and charge
Led by a delicate and tender prince,
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
Makes mouths at the invisible event,
Exposing what is mortal and unsure
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
Is not to stir without great argument,
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
Excitements of my reason and my blood,
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
Which is not tomb enough and continent
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
Exit

SCENE V. Elsinore. A room in the castle.
Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE, HORATIO, and a Gentleman
QUEEN GERTRUDE
I will not speak with her.
Gentleman
She is importunate, indeed distract:
Her mood will needs be pitied.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
What would she have?
Gentleman
She speaks much of her father; says she hears
There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures
yield them,
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
HORATIO
'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Let her come in.
Exit HORATIO

To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
Re-enter HORATIO, with OPHELIA

OPHELIA
Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
How now, Ophelia!
OPHELIA
[Sings]
How should I your true love know
From another one?
By his cockle hat and staff,
And his sandal shoon.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
OPHELIA
Say you? nay, pray you, mark.
Sings

He is dead and gone, lady,
He is dead and gone;
At his head a grass-green turf,
At his heels a stone.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Nay, but, Ophelia,--
OPHELIA
Pray you, mark.
Sings

White his shroud as the mountain snow,--
Enter KING CLAUDIUS

QUEEN GERTRUDE
Alas, look here, my lord.
OPHELIA
[Sings]
Larded with sweet flowers
Which bewept to the grave did go
With true-love showers.
KING CLAUDIUS
How do you, pretty lady?
OPHELIA
Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's
daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not
what we may be. God be at your table!
KING CLAUDIUS
Conceit upon her father.
OPHELIA
Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they
ask you what it means, say you this:
Sings

To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
All in the morning betime,
And I a maid at your window,
To be your Valentine.
Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,
And dupp'd the chamber-door;
Let in the maid, that out a maid
Never departed more.
KING CLAUDIUS
Pretty Ophelia!
OPHELIA
Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
Sings

By Gis and by Saint Charity,
Alack, and fie for shame!
Young men will do't, if they come to't;
By cock, they are to blame.
Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
You promised me to wed.
So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
An thou hadst not come to my bed.
KING CLAUDIUS
How long hath she been thus?
OPHELIA
I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I
cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him
i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:
and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my
coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;
good night, good night.
Exit

KING CLAUDIUS
Follow her close; give her good watch,
I pray you.
Exit HORATIO

O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
When sorrows come, they come not single spies
But in battalions. First, her father slain:
Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
Last, and as much containing as all these,
Her brother is in secret come from France;
Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
Will nothing stick our person to arraign
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
Like to a murdering-piece, in many places
Gives me superfluous death.
A noise within

QUEEN GERTRUDE
Alack, what noise is this?
KING CLAUDIUS
Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
Enter another Gentleman

What is the matter?
Gentleman
Save yourself, my lord:
The ocean, overpeering of his list,
Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
And, as the world were now but to begin,
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
The ratifiers and props of every word,
They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'
Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:
'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'
QUEEN GERTRUDE
How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
KING CLAUDIUS
The doors are broke.
Noise within

Enter LAERTES, armed; Danes following

LAERTES
Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.
Danes
No, let's come in.
LAERTES
I pray you, give me leave.
Danes
We will, we will.
They retire without the door

LAERTES
I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
Give me my father!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Calmly, good Laertes.
LAERTES
That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot
Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
Of my true mother.
KING CLAUDIUS
What is the cause, Laertes,
That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
That treason can but peep to what it would,
Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.
Speak, man.
LAERTES
Where is my father?
KING CLAUDIUS
Dead.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
But not by him.
KING CLAUDIUS
Let him demand his fill.
LAERTES
How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
That both the worlds I give to negligence,
Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged
Most thoroughly for my father.
KING CLAUDIUS
Who shall stay you?
LAERTES
My will, not all the world:
And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
They shall go far with little.
KING CLAUDIUS
Good Laertes,
If you desire to know the certainty
Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
Winner and loser?
LAERTES
None but his enemies.
KING CLAUDIUS
Will you know them then?
LAERTES
To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
Repast them with my blood.
KING CLAUDIUS
Why, now you speak
Like a good child and a true gentleman.
That I am guiltless of your father's death,
And am most sensible in grief for it,
It shall as level to your judgment pierce
As day does to your eye.
Danes
[Within] Let her come in.
LAERTES
How now! what noise is that?
Re-enter OPHELIA

O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
Should be as moral as an old man's life?
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
It sends some precious instance of itself
After the thing it loves.
OPHELIA
[Sings]
They bore him barefaced on the bier;
Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;
And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--
Fare you well, my dove!
LAERTES
Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
It could not move thus.
OPHELIA
[Sings]
You must sing a-down a-down,
An you call him a-down-a.
O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false
steward, that stole his master's daughter.
LAERTES
This nothing's more than matter.
OPHELIA
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,
love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.
LAERTES
A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.
OPHELIA
There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue
for you; and here's some for me: we may call it
herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with
a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you
some violets, but they withered all when my father
died: they say he made a good end,--
Sings

For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
LAERTES
Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
She turns to favour and to prettiness.
OPHELIA
[Sings]
And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
No, no, he is dead:
Go to thy death-bed:
He never will come again.
His beard was as white as snow,
All flaxen was his poll:
He is gone, he is gone,
And we cast away moan:
God ha' mercy on his soul!
And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.
Exit

LAERTES
Do you see this, O God?
KING CLAUDIUS
Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:
If by direct or by collateral hand
They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,
To you in satisfaction; but if not,
Be you content to lend your patience to us,
And we shall jointly labour with your soul
To give it due content.
LAERTES
Let this be so;
His means of death, his obscure funeral--
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
No noble rite nor formal ostentation--
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
That I must call't in question.
KING CLAUDIUS
So you shall;
And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
I pray you, go with me.
Exeunt

SCENE VI. Another room in the castle.
Enter HORATIO and a Servant
HORATIO
What are they that would speak with me?
Servant
Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.
HORATIO
Let them come in.
Exit Servant

I do not know from what part of the world
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
Enter Sailors

First Sailor
God bless you, sir.
HORATIO
Let him bless thee too.
First Sailor
He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was
bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am
let to know it is.
HORATIO
[Reads] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked
this, give these fellows some means to the king:
they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old
at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on
a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded
them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so
I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with
me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they
did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king
have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me
with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I
have words to speak in thine ear will make thee
dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of
the matter. These good fellows will bring thee
where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
course for England: of them I have much to tell
thee. Farewell.
'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
Come, I will make you way for these your letters;
And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
To him from whom you brought them.
Exeunt

SCENE VII. Another room in the castle.
Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES
KING CLAUDIUS
Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
And you must put me in your heart for friend,
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
That he which hath your noble father slain
Pursued my life.
LAERTES
It well appears: but tell me
Why you proceeded not against these feats,
So crimeful and so capital in nature,
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
You mainly were stirr'd up.
KING CLAUDIUS
O, for two special reasons;
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
I could not but by her. The other motive,
Why to a public count I might not go,
Is the great love the general gender bear him;
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
Would have reverted to my bow again,
And not where I had aim'd them.
LAERTES
And so have I a noble father lost;
A sister driven into desperate terms,
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
Stood challenger on mount of all the age
For her perfections: but my revenge will come.
KING CLAUDIUS
Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
That we can let our beard be shook with danger
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
I loved your father, and we love ourself;
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--
Enter a Messenger

How now! what news?
Messenger
Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
This to your majesty; this to the queen.
KING CLAUDIUS
From Hamlet! who brought them?
Messenger
Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
They were given me by Claudio; he received them
Of him that brought them.
KING CLAUDIUS
Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.
Exit Messenger

Reads

'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on
your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see
your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your
pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden
and more strange return. 'HAMLET.'
What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
LAERTES
Know you the hand?
KING CLAUDIUS
'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
Can you advise me?
LAERTES
I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
It warms the very sickness in my heart,
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
'Thus didest thou.'
KING CLAUDIUS
If it be so, Laertes--
As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
Will you be ruled by me?
LAERTES
Ay, my lord;
So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
KING CLAUDIUS
To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
As checking at his voyage, and that he means
No more to undertake it, I will work him
To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
And call it accident.
LAERTES
My lord, I will be ruled;
The rather, if you could devise it so
That I might be the organ.
KING CLAUDIUS
It falls right.
You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts
Did not together pluck such envy from him
As did that one, and that, in my regard,
Of the unworthiest siege.
LAERTES
What part is that, my lord?
KING CLAUDIUS
A very riband in the cap of youth,
Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
The light and careless livery that it wears
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
Come short of what he did.
LAERTES
A Norman was't?
KING CLAUDIUS
A Norman.
LAERTES
Upon my life, Lamond.
KING CLAUDIUS
The very same.
LAERTES
I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
And gem of all the nation.
KING CLAUDIUS
He made confession of you,
And gave you such a masterly report
For art and exercise in your defence
And for your rapier most especially,
That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
That he could nothing do but wish and beg
Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
Now, out of this,--
LAERTES
What out of this, my lord?
KING CLAUDIUS
Laertes, was your father dear to you?
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
A face without a heart?
LAERTES
Why ask you this?
KING CLAUDIUS
Not that I think you did not love your father;
But that I know love is begun by time;
And that I see, in passages of proof,
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
There lives within the very flame of love
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
And nothing is at a like goodness still;
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
Dies in his own too much: that we would do
We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
And hath abatements and delays as many
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
To show yourself your father's son in deed
More than in words?
LAERTES
To cut his throat i' the church.
KING CLAUDIUS
No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
And set a double varnish on the fame
The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
Most generous and free from all contriving,
Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
Requite him for your father.
LAERTES
I will do't:
And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
I bought an unction of a mountebank,
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
Collected from all simples that have virtue
Under the moon, can save the thing from death
That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
It may be death.
KING CLAUDIUS
Let's further think of this;
Weigh what convenience both of time and means
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
And that our drift look through our bad performance,
'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
Should have a back or second, that might hold,
If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
When in your motion you are hot and dry--
As make your bouts more violent to that end--
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
Our purpose may hold there.
Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE

How now, sweet queen!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
LAERTES
Drown'd! O, where?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
There with fantastic garlands did she come
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
When down her weedy trophies and herself
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
As one incapable of her own distress,
Or like a creature native and indued
Unto that element: but long it could not be
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
To muddy death.
LAERTES
Alas, then, she is drown'd?
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Drown'd, drown'd.
LAERTES
Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
But that this folly douts it.
Exit

KING CLAUDIUS
Let's follow, Gertrude:
How much I had to do to calm his rage!
Now fear I this will give it start again;
Therefore let's follow.
Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. A churchyard.
Enter two Clowns, with spades, & c
First Clown
Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
wilfully seeks her own salvation?
Second Clown
I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave
straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it
Christian burial.
First Clown
How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her
own defence?
Second Clown
Why, 'tis found so.
First Clown
It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For
here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,
it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it
is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned
herself wittingly.
Second Clown
Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--
First Clown
Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here
stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,
and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he
goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him
and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he
that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
Second Clown
But is this law?
First Clown
Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.
Second Clown
Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been
a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'
Christian burial.
First Clown
Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that
great folk should have countenance in this world to
drown or hang themselves, more than their even
Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient
gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:
they hold up Adam's profession.
Second Clown
Was he a gentleman?
First Clown
He was the first that ever bore arms.
Second Clown
Why, he had none.
First Clown
What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'
could he dig without arms? I'll put another
question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
purpose, confess thyself--
Second Clown
Go to.
First Clown
What is he that builds stronger than either the
mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
Second Clown
The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a
thousand tenants.
First Clown
I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows
does well; but how does it well? it does well to
those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the
gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.
Second Clown
'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or
a carpenter?'
First Clown
Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
Second Clown
Marry, now I can tell.
First Clown
To't.
Second Clown
Mass, I cannot tell.
Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance

First Clown
Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull
ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when
you are asked this question next, say 'a
grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till
doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a
stoup of liquor.
Exit Second Clown

He digs and sings

In youth, when I did love, did love,
Methought it was very sweet,
To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,
O, methought, there was nothing meet.
HAMLET
Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he
sings at grave-making?
HORATIO
Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
HAMLET
'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath
the daintier sense.
First Clown
[Sings]
But age, with his stealing steps,
Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
And hath shipped me intil the land,
As if I had never been such.
Throws up a skull

HAMLET
That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:
how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were
Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It
might be the pate of a politician, which this ass
now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,
might it not?
HORATIO
It might, my lord.
HAMLET
Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,
sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might
be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord
such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?
HORATIO
Ay, my lord.
HAMLET
Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and
knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:
here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to
see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,
but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.
First Clown
[Sings]
A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
For and a shrouding sheet:
O, a pit of clay for to be made
For such a guest is meet.
Throws up another skull

HAMLET
There's another: why may not that be the skull of a
lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he
suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of
his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be
in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and
the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him
no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than
the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The
very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?
HORATIO
Not a jot more, my lord.
HAMLET
Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
HORATIO
Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.
HAMLET
They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose
grave's this, sirrah?
First Clown
Mine, sir.
Sings

O, a pit of clay for to be made
For such a guest is meet.
HAMLET
I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.
First Clown
You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not
yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.
HAMLET
'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
First Clown
'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to
you.
HAMLET
What man dost thou dig it for?
First Clown
For no man, sir.
HAMLET
What woman, then?
First Clown
For none, neither.
HAMLET
Who is to be buried in't?
First Clown
One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
HAMLET
How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the
card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he
gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a
grave-maker?
First Clown
Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day
that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
HAMLET
How long is that since?
First Clown
Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that
is mad, and sent into England.
HAMLET
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
First Clown
Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
HAMLET
Why?
First Clown
'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men
are as mad as he.
HAMLET
How came he mad?
First Clown
Very strangely, they say.
HAMLET
How strangely?
First Clown
Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
HAMLET
Upon what ground?
First Clown
Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man
and boy, thirty years.
HAMLET
How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
First Clown
I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we
have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce
hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year
or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.
HAMLET
Why he more than another?
First Clown
Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
he will keep out water a great while; and your water
is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
three and twenty years.
HAMLET
Whose was it?
First Clown
A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
HAMLET
Nay, I know not.
First Clown
A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.
HAMLET
This?
First Clown
E'en that.
HAMLET
Let me see.
Takes the skull

Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath
borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how
abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at
it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your
gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one
now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let
her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must
come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell
me one thing.
HORATIO
What's that, my lord?
HAMLET
Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
the earth?
HORATIO
E'en so.
HAMLET
And smelt so? pah!
Puts down the skull

HORATIO
E'en so, my lord.
HAMLET
To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may
not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
till he find it stopping a bung-hole?
HORATIO
'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
HAMLET
No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as
thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of
earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he
was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.
Enter Priest, & c. in procession; the Corpse of OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains, & c

The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
The corse they follow did with desperate hand
Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.
Couch we awhile, and mark.
Retiring with HORATIO

LAERTES
What ceremony else?
HAMLET
That is Laertes,
A very noble youth: mark.
LAERTES
What ceremony else?
First Priest
Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,
Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;
Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
Of bell and burial.
LAERTES
Must there no more be done?
First Priest
No more be done:
We should profane the service of the dead
To sing a requiem and such rest to her
As to peace-parted souls.
LAERTES
Lay her i' the earth:
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
A ministering angel shall my sister be,
When thou liest howling.
HAMLET
What, the fair Ophelia!
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
Scattering flowers

I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
And not have strew'd thy grave.
LAERTES
O, treble woe
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
Leaps into the grave

Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head
Of blue Olympus.
HAMLET
[Advancing] What is he whose grief
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
Hamlet the Dane.
Leaps into the grave

LAERTES
The devil take thy soul!
Grappling with him

HAMLET
Thou pray'st not well.
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
Yet have I something in me dangerous,
Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.
KING CLAUDIUS
Pluck them asunder.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Hamlet, Hamlet!
All
Gentlemen,--
HORATIO
Good my lord, be quiet.
The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave

HAMLET
Why I will fight with him upon this theme
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
O my son, what theme?
HAMLET
I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
Could not, with all their quantity of love,
Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
KING CLAUDIUS
O, he is mad, Laertes.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
For love of God, forbear him.
HAMLET
'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
I'll rant as well as thou.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
This is mere madness:
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
Anon, as patient as the female dove,
When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
His silence will sit drooping.
HAMLET
Hear you, sir;
What is the reason that you use me thus?
I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
Let Hercules himself do what he may,
The cat will mew and dog will have his day.
Exit

KING CLAUDIUS
I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
Exit HORATIO

To LAERTES

Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
We'll put the matter to the present push.
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
This grave shall have a living monument:
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
Exeunt

SCENE II. A hall in the castle.
Enter HAMLET and HORATIO
HAMLET
So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
You do remember all the circumstance?
HORATIO
Remember it, my lord?
HAMLET
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
Rough-hew them how we will,--
HORATIO
That is most certain.
HAMLET
Up from my cabin,
My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
To mine own room again; making so bold,
My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
O royal knavery!--an exact command,
Larded with many several sorts of reasons
Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
My head should be struck off.
HORATIO
Is't possible?
HAMLET
Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
HORATIO
I beseech you.
HAMLET
Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
They had begun the play--I sat me down,
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
The effect of what I wrote?
HORATIO
Ay, good my lord.
HAMLET
An earnest conjuration from the king,
As England was his faithful tributary,
As love between them like the palm might flourish,
As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
Without debatement further, more or less,
He should the bearers put to sudden death,
Not shriving-time allow'd.
HORATIO
How was this seal'd?
HAMLET
Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
I had my father's signet in my purse,
Which was the model of that Danish seal;
Folded the writ up in form of the other,
Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
The changeling never known. Now, the next day
Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
Thou know'st already.
HORATIO
So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
HAMLET
Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
They are not near my conscience; their defeat
Does by their own insinuation grow:
'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
Between the pass and fell incensed points
Of mighty opposites.
HORATIO
Why, what a king is this!
HAMLET
Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
To let this canker of our nature come
In further evil?
HORATIO
It must be shortly known to him from England
What is the issue of the business there.
HAMLET
It will be short: the interim is mine;
And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
That to Laertes I forgot myself;
For, by the image of my cause, I see
The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
Into a towering passion.
HORATIO
Peace! who comes here?
Enter OSRIC

OSRIC
Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
HAMLET
I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
HORATIO
No, my good lord.
HAMLET
Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a
beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
spacious in the possession of dirt.
OSRIC
Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
should impart a thing to you from his majesty.
HAMLET
I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
OSRIC
I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
HAMLET
No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
northerly.
OSRIC
It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
HAMLET
But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
complexion.
OSRIC
Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as
'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--
HAMLET
I beseech you, remember--
HAMLET moves him to put on his hat

OSRIC
Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
differences, of very soft society and great showing:
indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
continent of what part a gentleman would see.
HAMLET
Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great article; and his infusion of such dearth and
rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace
him, his umbrage, nothing more.
OSRIC
Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
HAMLET
The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
in our more rawer breath?
OSRIC
Sir?
HORATIO
Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
You will do't, sir, really.
HAMLET
What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
OSRIC
Of Laertes?
HORATIO
His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
HAMLET
Of him, sir.
OSRIC
I know you are not ignorant--
HAMLET
I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
OSRIC
You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--
HAMLET
I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to
know himself.
OSRIC
I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
HAMLET
What's his weapon?
OSRIC
Rapier and dagger.
HAMLET
That's two of his weapons: but, well.
OSRIC
The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take
it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
and of very liberal conceit.
HAMLET
What call you the carriages?
HORATIO
I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
OSRIC
The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
HAMLET
The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
against six French swords, their assigns, and three
liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
OSRIC
The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
would vouchsafe the answer.
HAMLET
How if I answer 'no'?
OSRIC
I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
HAMLET
Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
OSRIC
Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
HAMLET
To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
OSRIC
I commend my duty to your lordship.
HAMLET
Yours, yours.
Exit OSRIC

He does well to commend it himself; there are no
tongues else for's turn.
HORATIO
This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
HAMLET
He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of
yesty collection, which carries them through and
through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do
but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.
Enter a Lord

Lord
My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
HAMLET
I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now
or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
Lord
The king and queen and all are coming down.
HAMLET
In happy time.
Lord
The queen desires you to use some gentle
entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
HAMLET
She well instructs me.
Exit Lord

HORATIO
You will lose this wager, my lord.
HAMLET
I do not think so: since he went into France, I
have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
about my heart: but it is no matter.
HORATIO
Nay, good my lord,--
HAMLET
It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.
HORATIO
If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
fit.
HAMLET
Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the
readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he
leaves, what is't to leave betimes?
Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, & c

KING CLAUDIUS
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's

HAMLET
Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
This presence knows,
And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
With sore distraction. What I have done,
That might your nature, honour and exception
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
Sir, in this audience,
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
And hurt my brother.
LAERTES
I am satisfied in nature,
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
I have a voice and precedent of peace,
To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
I do receive your offer'd love like love,
And will not wrong it.
HAMLET
I embrace it freely;
And will this brother's wager frankly play.
Give us the foils. Come on.
LAERTES
Come, one for me.
HAMLET
I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
Stick fiery off indeed.
LAERTES
You mock me, sir.
HAMLET
No, by this hand.
KING CLAUDIUS
Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
You know the wager?
HAMLET
Very well, my lord
Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.
KING CLAUDIUS
I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
LAERTES
This is too heavy, let me see another.
HAMLET
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
They prepare to play

OSRIC
Ay, my good lord.
KING CLAUDIUS
Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
And in the cup an union shall he throw,
Richer than that which four successive kings
In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
HAMLET
Come on, sir.
LAERTES
Come, my lord.
They play

HAMLET
One.
LAERTES
No.
HAMLET
Judgment.
OSRIC
A hit, a very palpable hit.
LAERTES
Well; again.
KING CLAUDIUS
Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
Here's to thy health.
Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within

Give him the cup.
HAMLET
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.
They play

Another hit; what say you?
LAERTES
A touch, a touch, I do confess.
KING CLAUDIUS
Our son shall win.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
He's fat, and scant of breath.
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
HAMLET
Good madam!
KING CLAUDIUS
Gertrude, do not drink.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.
KING CLAUDIUS
[Aside] It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.
HAMLET
I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
Come, let me wipe thy face.
LAERTES
My lord, I'll hit him now.
KING CLAUDIUS
I do not think't.
LAERTES
[Aside] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
HAMLET
Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
I pray you, pass with your best violence;
I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
LAERTES
Say you so? come on.
They play

OSRIC
Nothing, neither way.
LAERTES
Have at you now!
LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES

KING CLAUDIUS
Part them; they are incensed.
HAMLET
Nay, come, again.
QUEEN GERTRUDE falls

OSRIC
Look to the queen there, ho!
HORATIO
They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
OSRIC
How is't, Laertes?
LAERTES
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
HAMLET
How does the queen?
KING CLAUDIUS
She swounds to see them bleed.
QUEEN GERTRUDE
No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.
Dies

HAMLET
O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
Treachery! Seek it out.
LAERTES
It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
No medicine in the world can do thee good;
In thee there is not half an hour of life;
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise
Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
HAMLET
The point!--envenom'd too!
Then, venom, to thy work.
Stabs KING CLAUDIUS

All
Treason! treason!
KING CLAUDIUS
O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
HAMLET
Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
Follow my mother.
KING CLAUDIUS dies

LAERTES
He is justly served;
It is a poison temper'd by himself.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
Nor thine on me.
Dies

HAMLET
Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
That are but mutes or audience to this act,
Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
To the unsatisfied.
HORATIO
Never believe it:
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
Here's yet some liquor left.
HAMLET
As thou'rt a man,
Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
To tell my story.
March afar off, and shot within

What warlike noise is this?
OSRIC
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
To the ambassadors of England gives
This warlike volley.
HAMLET
O, I die, Horatio;
The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
I cannot live to hear the news from England;
But I do prophesy the election lights
On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
Which have solicited. The rest is silence.
Dies

HORATIO
Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
Why does the drum come hither?
March within

Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and others

PRINCE FORTINBRAS
Where is this sight?
HORATIO
What is it ye would see?
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
That thou so many princes at a shot
So bloodily hast struck?
First Ambassador
The sight is dismal;
And our affairs from England come too late:
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
Where should we have our thanks?
HORATIO
Not from his mouth,
Had it the ability of life to thank you:
He never gave commandment for their death.
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
Are here arrived give order that these bodies
High on a stage be placed to the view;
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
How these things came about: so shall you hear
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I
Truly deliver.
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
Let us haste to hear it,
And call the noblest to the audience.
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
HORATIO
Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
But let this same be presently perform'd,
Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance
On plots and errors, happen.
PRINCE FORTINBRAS
Let four captains
Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
For he was likely, had he been put on,
To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
The soldiers' music and the rites of war
Speak loudly for him.
Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off
